Although not all the features of EventStoreDB are supported\nby this client, many of the most useful features are presented\nin an easy-to-use interface.\n\nThis client has been tested to work with EventStoreDB LTS versions 21.10\nand 22.10, without and without SSL/TLS, and with Python versions 3.7 to 3.11.\nThere is 100% test coverage. The code has typing annotations, checked with mypy.\nThe code is formatted with black and isort, and checked with flake8. Poetry\nis used for package management during development, and for building and\npublishing distributions to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/esdbclient/).\n\n## Synopsis\n\nYou can connect to an EventStoreDB database using the `EventStoreDBClient` class.\n\nThe `EventStoreDBClient` class can be imported from the `esdbclient` package.\n\nProbably the three most useful methods of `EventStoreDBClient` are:\n\n* `append_to_stream()` This method can be used to record new events in a particular\n"stream". This is useful, for example, when executing a command in an application\nthat mutates an aggregate. This method is "atomic" in that either all or none of\nthe events will be recorded.\n\n* `read_stream()` This method can be used to retrieve all the recorded\nevents in a "stream". This is useful, for example, when reconstructing\nan aggregate from recorded events before executing a command in an\napplication that creates new events.\n\n* `subscribe_to_all()` This method can be used to receive all recorded events in\nthe database. This is useful, for example, in event-processing components because\nit supports processing events with "exactly-once" semantics.\n\nThe example below uses an "insecure" EventStoreDB server running locally on port 2113.\n\n```python\nimport uuid\n\nfrom esdbclient import EventStoreDBClient, NewEvent, StreamState\n\n\n# Construct EventStoreDBClient with an EventStoreDB URI. The\n# connection string URI specifies that the client should\n# connect to an "insecure" server running on port 2113.\n\nclient = EventStoreDBClient(\n    uri="esdb://localhost:2113?Tls=false"\n)\n\n\n# Generate new events. Typically, domain events of different\n# types are generated in a domain model, and then serialized\n# into NewEvent objects. An aggregate ID may be used as the\n# name of a stream in EventStoreDB.\n\nstream_name1 = str(uuid.uuid4())\nevent1 = NewEvent(\n    type=\'OrderCreated\',\n    data=b\'{"order_number": "123456"}\'\n)\nevent2 = NewEvent(\n    type=\'OrderSubmitted\',\n    data=b\'{}\'\n)\nevent3 = NewEvent(\n    type=\'OrderCancelled\',\n    data=b\'{}\'\n)\n\n\n# Append new events to a new stream. The value returned\n# from the append_to_stream() method is the overall\n# "commit position" in the database of the last new event\n# recorded by this operation. The returned "commit position"\n# may be used in a user interface to poll an eventually\n# consistent event-processing component until it can\n# present an up-to-date materialized view. New events are\n# each allocated a "stream position", which is the next\n# available position in the stream, starting from 0.\n\ncommit_position1 = client.append_to_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name1,\n    current_version=StreamState.NO_STREAM,\n    events=[event1, event2],\n)\n\n# Append events to an existing stream. The "current version"\n# is the "stream position" of the last recorded event in a\n# stream. We have recorded two new events, so the "current\n# version" is 1.

The connection string for this "secure" EventStoreDB\nserver would be:\n\n    esdb://admin:changeit@localhost:2113\n\nTo connect to a "secure" server, you will usually need to include a "username"\nand a "password" in the connection string, so that the server can authenticate the\nclient. With EventStoreDB, the default username is "admin" and the default password\nis "changeit".\n\nWhen connecting to a "secure" server, your client will also need an SSL/TLS certificate\nas the value of its `root_certificates` constructor argument. The client uses the\nSSL/TLS certificate to authenticate the server. For development, you can either use the\nSSL/TLS certificate of the certificate authority used to create the server\'s certificate,\nor when using a single-node cluster, you can use the server certificate itself. You can\nget the server certificate with the following Python code.\n\n\n```python\nimport ssl\n\nserver_certificate = ssl.get_server_certificate(addr=(\'localhost\', 2113))\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can start an "insecure" server using the following command.\n\n    $ docker run -d --name eventstoredb-insecure -it -p 2113:2113 eventstore/eventstore:21.10.9-buster-slim --insecure\n\nThe connection string URI for this "insecure" server would be:\n\n    esdb://localhost:2113?Tls=false\n\nAs we will see, when connecting to an "insecure" server, there is no need to include\na "username" and a "password" in the connection string. If you do, these values will\nbe ignored by the client, so that they are not sent over an insecure channel.\n\nPlease note, the "insecure" connection string uses a query string with the field-value\n`Tls=false`. The value of this field is by default `true`.\n\n### Stop container\n\nTo stop and remove the "secure" container, use the following Docker commands.\n\n    $ docker stop eventstoredb-secure\n\t$ docker rm eventstoredb-secure\n\nTo stop and remove the "insecure" container, use the following Docker commands.\n\n    $ docker stop eventstoredb-insecure\n\t$ docker rm eventstoredb-insecure\n\n\n## EventStoreDB client\n\nThis EventStoreDB client is implemented in the `esdbclient` package with\nthe `EventStoreDBClient` class.\n\n### Import class\n\nThe `EventStoreDBClient` class can be imported from the `esdbclient` package.\n\n```python\nfrom esdbclient import EventStoreDBClient\n```\n\n### Construct client\n\nThe `EventStoreDBClient` class has one required constructor argument, `uri`, and one\noptional constructor argument, `root_certificates`.\n\nThe `uri` argument is expected to be an EventStoreDB connection string URI that\nconforms with the standard EventStoreDB "esdb" or "esdb+discover" URI schemes.\n\nFor example, the following connection string specifies that the client should\nattempt to create a "secure" connection to port 2113 on "localhost", and use the\nclient credentials "username" and "password" when making calls to the server.\n\n    esdb://username:password@localhost:2113?Tls=true\n\nThe client must be configured to create a "secure" connection to a "secure" server,\nor alternatively an "insecure" connection to an "insecure" server. By default, the\nclient will attempt to create a "secure" connection. And so, when connecting to an\n"insecure" server, the connection string must specify that the client should attempt\nto make an "insecure" connection.\n\nThe following connection string specifies that the client should\nattempt to create an "insecure" connection to port 2113 on "localhost".\nWhen connecting to an "insecure" server, the client will ignore any\nusername and password information included in the connection string,\nso that usernames and passwords are not sent over an "insecure" connection.\n\n    esdb://localhost:2113?Tls=false\n\nPlease note, the "insecure" connection string uses a query string with the field-value\n`Tls=false`. The value of this field is by default `true`. Unless the connection string\nURI includes the field-value `Tls=false` in the query string, the `root_certificates`\nconstructor argument is also required.\n\nWhen connecting to a "secure" server, the `root_certificates` argument is expected to\nbe a Python `str` containing PEM encoded SSL/TLS root certificates. This value is\npassed directly to `grpc.ssl_channel_credentials()`. It is used for authenticating the\nserver to the client. It is commonly the certificate of the certificate authority that\nwas responsible for generating the SSL/TLS certificate used by the EventStoreDB server.\nBut, alternatively for development, you can use the server\'s certificate itself.\n\nIn the example below, the constructor argument values are taken from the operating\nsystem environment. This is a typical arrangement in a production environment. It is\ndone this way here so that the code in this documentation can be tested with both\na "secure" and an "insecure" server.\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nclient = EventStoreDBClient(\n    uri=os.getenv("ESDB_URI"),\n    root_certificates=os.getenv("ESDB_ROOT_CERTIFICATES"),\n)\n```\n\n## Connection strings\n\nAn EventStoreDB connection string is a URI that conforms with one of two possible\nschemes: either the "esdb" scheme, or the "esdb+discover" scheme.\n\nThe syntax and semantics of the EventStoreDB URI schemes are described below. The\nsyntax is defined using [EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus–Naur_form).\n\n### Two schemes\n\nThe "esdb" URI scheme can be defined in the following way.\n\n    esdb-uri = "esdb://" , [ user-info , "@" ] , grpc-target, { "," , grpc-target } , [ "?" , query-string ] ;\n\nIn the "esdb" URI scheme, after the optional user info string, there must be at least\none gRPC target. If there are several gRPC targets, they must be separated from each\nother with the "," character. Each gRPC target should indicate an EventStoreDB gRPC\nserver socket, by specifying a host and a port number separated with the ":" character.\nThe host may be a hostname that can be resolved to an IP address, or an IP address.\n\n    grpc-target = ( hostname | ip-address ) , ":" , port-number ;\n\n\nThe "esdb+discover" URI scheme can be defined in the following way.\n\n    esdb-discover-uri = "esdb+discover://" , [ user-info, "@" ] , cluster-domainname , [ "?" , query-string ] ;\n\nIn the "esdb+discover" URI scheme, after the optional user info string, there must be a\ndomain name which should identify a cluster of EventStoreDB servers. The client will use\na DNS server to resolve the domain name to a list of addresses of EventStoreDB servers,\nby querying for \'A\' records. In this case, the port number "2113" will be used to\nconstruct gRPC targets from the addresses obtained from \'A\' records provided by the\nDNS server. Therefore, if you want to use the "esdb+discover" URI scheme, you will\nneed to configure DNS when setting up your EventStoreDB cluster.\n\nWith both the "esdb" and "esdb+discover" URI schemes, the client firstly obtains\na list of gRPC targets: either directly from "esdb" connection strings; or indirectly\nfrom "esdb+discover" connection strings via DNS. This list of targets is known as the\n"gossip seed". The client will then attempt to connect to each gRPC target in turn,\nattempting to call the EventStoreDB Gossip API to obtain information about the\nEventStoreDB cluster. A member of the cluster is selected by the client, according\nto the "node preference" option. The client may then need to close its\nconnection and reconnect to the selected server.\n\n### User info string\n\nIn both the "esdb" and "esdb+discover" schemes, the URI may include a user info string.\nIf it exists in the URI, the user info string must be separated from the rest of the URI\nwith the "@" character. The user info string must include a username and a password,\nseparated with the ":" character.\n\n    user-info = username , ":" , password ;\n\nThe user info is sent by the client as "call credentials" in each call to a "secure"\nserver, in a "basic auth" authorization header. This authorization header is used by\nthe server to authenticate the client. The authorization header is not sent to\n"insecure" servers.\n\n### Query string\n\nIn both the "esdb" and "esdb+discover" schemes, the optional query string must be one\nor many field-value arguments, separated from each other with the "&" character.\n\n    query-string = field-value, { "&", field-value } ;\n\nEach field-value argument must be one of the supported fields, and an\nappropriate value, separated with the "=" character.\n\n    field-value = ( "Tls", "=" , "true" | "false" )\n                | ( "TlsVerifyCert", "=" , "true" | "false" )\n                | ( "ConnectionName", "=" , string )\n                | ( "NodePreference", "=" , "leader" | "follower" | "readonlyreplica" | "random" )\n                | ( "DefaultDeadline", "=" , integer )\n                | ( "GossipTimeout", "=" , integer )\n                | ( "MaxDiscoverAttempts", "=" , integer )\n                | ( "DiscoveryInterval", "=" , integer )\n                | ( "MaxDiscoverAttempts", "=" , integer )\n                | ( "KeepAliveInterval", "=" , integer )\n                | ( "KeepAliveInterval", "=" , integer ) ;\n\nThe table below describes the query field-values supported by this client.\n\n| Field               | Value                                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                       |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Tls                 | "true", "false" (default: "true")                                     | If "true" the client will create a "secure" gRPC channel.

And\nthen to connect to a "leader" node. And also to use "admin" and\n"changeit" as the username and password when making calls to\nEventStoreDB API methods.\n\n    esdb://admin:changeit@localhost:2113\n\n\nThe following URI will cause the client to get cluster info from\n"insecure" server socket 127.0.0.1:2113.  And then to connect to\na "leader" node.\n\n    esdb://127.0.0.1:2113?Tls=false\n\n\nThe following URI will cause the client to get cluster info from\naddresses in DNS \'A\' records for cluster1.example.com. And then\nto connect to a "leader" node. And use a default deadline of 5\nseconds when making calls to EventStore API "write" methods.\n\n    esdb+discover://admin:changeit@cluster1.example.com?DefaultDeadline=5\n\n\nThe following URI will cause the client to get cluster info from either\nlocalhost:2111, or localhost:2112, or localhost:2113. And then to connect\nto a "follower" node.\n\n    esdb://admin:changeit@localhost:2111,localhost:2112,localhost:2113?NodePreference=follower\n\n\nThe following URI will cause the client to get cluster info from addresses in\nDNS \'A\' records for cluster1.example.com. And to configure "keep alive" timeout\nand interval in the gRPC channel.\n\n    esdb+discover://admin:changeit@cluster1.example.com?KeepAliveInterval=10000&KeepAliveTimeout=10000\n\n\nPlease note, the client is insensitive to the case of fields and values. If fields are\nrepeated in the query string, the query string will be parsed without error. However,\nthe connection options used by the client will use the value of the first field. All\nthe other field-values in the query string with the same field name will be ignored.\nFields without values will also be ignored.\n\nIf the client\'s node preference is "leader" and the node becomes a\n"follower", the client will attempt to reconnect to the current leader when a method\nis called that expects to call a leader. Methods which mutate the state of the database\nexpect to call a leader. For such methods, the HTTP header "requires-leader" is set to\n"true", and this header is observed by the server, and so a node which is not a leader\nthat receives such a request will return an error. This error is detected by the client,\nwhich will then close the current gRPC connection and create a new connection to the\nleader. The request will then be retried with the leader.\n\nIf the client\'s node preference is "follower" and there are no follower\nnodes in the cluster, then the client will raise an exception. Similarly, if the\nclient\'s node preference is "readonlyreplica" and there are no read-only replica\nnodes in the cluster, then the client will also raise an exception.\n\nThe gRPC channel option "grpc.max_receive_message_length" is automatically\nconfigured to the value `17 * 1024 * 1024`. This value cannot be changed.\n\n\n## Event objects\n\nThis package defines a `NewEvent` class and a `RecordedEvent` class. The\n`NewEvent` class should be used when writing events to the database. The\n`RecordedEvent` class is used when reading events from the database.\n\n### New events\n\nThe `NewEvent` class should be used when writing events to an EventStoreDB database.\nYou will need to construct new event objects before calling `append_to_stream()`.\n\nThe `NewEvent` class is a frozen Python dataclass. It has two required constructor\narguments (`type` and `data`) and three optional constructor arguments (`metadata`,\n`content_type` and `id`).\n\nThe required `type` argument is a Python `str`, used to describe the type of\ndomain event that is being recorded.\n\nThe required `data` argument is a Python `bytes` object, used to state the\nserialized data of the domain event that is being recorded.\n\nThe optional `metadata` argument is a Python `bytes` object, used to indicate any\nmetadata of the event that will be recorded. The default value is an empty `bytes`\nobject.\n\nThe optional `content_type` argument is a Python `str`, used to indicate the\nkind of data that is being recorded. The default value is `\'application/json\'`,\nwhich indicates that the `data` was serialised using JSON. An alternative value\nfor this argument is the more general indication `\'application/octet-stream\'`.\n\nThe optional `id` argument is a Python `UUID` object, used to specify the unique ID\nof the event that will be recorded. If no value is provided, a new version-4 UUID\nwill be generated.\n\n```python\nnew_event1 = NewEvent(\n    type=\'OrderCreated\',\n    data=b\'{"name": "Greg"}\',\n)\nassert new_event1.type == \'OrderCreated\'\nassert new_event1.data == b\'{"name": "Greg"}\'\nassert new_event1.metadata == b\'\'\nassert new_event1.content_type == \'application/json\'\nassert isinstance(new_event1.id, uuid.UUID)\n\nevent_id = uuid.uuid4()\nnew_event2 = NewEvent(\n    type=\'ImageCreated\',\n    data=b\'01010101010101\',\n    metadata=b\'{"a": 1}\',\n    content_type=\'application/octet-stream\',\n    id=event_id,\n)\nassert new_event2.type == \'ImageCreated\'\nassert new_event2.data == b\'01010101010101\'\nassert new_event2.metadata == b\'{"a": 1}\'\nassert new_event2.content_type == \'application/octet-stream\'\nassert new_event2.id == event_id\n```\n\n### Recorded events\n\nThe `RecordedEvent` class is used when reading events from an EventStoreDB\ndatabase. The client will return event objects of this type from all methods\nthat return recorded events, such as `get_stream()`, `subscribe_to_all()`,\nand `read_subscription_to_all()`. You do not need to construct recorded event objects.\n\nLike `NewEvent`, the `RecordedEvent` class is also a frozen Python dataclass. It has\nall the attributes that `NewEvent` has (`type`, `data`, `metadata`, `content_type`, `id`)\nand some additional attributes that follow from the fact that an event was recorded\n(`stream_name`, `stream_position`, `commit_position`).\n\nThe `type` attribute is a Python `str`, used to indicate the type of an event\nthat was recorded.\n\nThe `data` attribute is a Python `bytes` object, used to indicate the data of an\nevent that was recorded.\n\nThe `metadata` attribute is a Python `bytes` object, used to indicate the metadata of\nan event that was recorded.\n\nThe `content_type` attribute is a Python `str`, used to indicate the type of\ndata that was recorded for an event. It is usually `\'application/json\'`, indicating\nthat the data can be parsed as JSON. Alternatively, it is `\'application/octet-stream\'`.\n\nThe `id` attribute is a Python `UUID` object, used to indicate the unique ID of an\nevent that was recorded.\n\nThe `stream_name` attribute is a Python `str`, used to indicate the name of a\nstream in which an event was recorded.\n\nThe `stream_position` attribute is a Python `int`, used to indicate the position in a\nstream at which an event was recorded.\n\nIn EventStoreDB, a "stream position" is an integer representing the position of a\nrecorded event in a stream. Each recorded event is recorded at a position in a stream.\nEach stream position is occupied by only one recorded event. New events are recorded at the\nnext unoccupied position. All sequences of stream positions are zero-based and gapless.\n\nThe `commit_position` attribute is a Python `int`, used to indicate the position in the\ndatabase at which an event was recorded.\n\nIn EventStoreDB, a "commit position" is an integer representing the position of a\nrecorded event in the database. Each recorded event is recorded at a position in the\ndatabase. Each commit position is occupied by only one recorded event. Commit positions\nare zero-based and increase monotonically as new events are recorded. But, unlike stream\npositions, the sequence of successive commit positions is not gapless. Indeed, there are\nusually large differences between the commit positions of successively recorded events.\n\nPlease note, in EventStoreDB 21.10, the `commit_position` of all `RecordedEvent` objects\nobtained from `read_stream()` is `None`, whereas those obtained from `read_all()` have\nthe actual commit position of the recorded event. This was changed in version 22.10, so\nthat event objects obtained from both `get_stream()` and `read_all()` have the actual\ncommit position. The `commit_position` attribute of the `RecordedEvent` class is\nannotated with the type `Optional[int]` for this reason only.\n\n\n```python\nfrom esdbclient.events import RecordedEvent\n\nrecorded_event = RecordedEvent(\n    type=\'OrderCreated\',\n    data=b\'{}\',\n    metadata=b\'\',\n    content_type=\'application/json\',\n    id=uuid.uuid4(),\n    stream_name=\'stream1\',\n    stream_position=0,\n    commit_position=512,\n)\n```\n\n\n## Streams\n\nIn EventStoreDB, a "stream" is a sequence of recorded events that all have\nthe same "stream name". There will normally be many streams in a database,\neach with many recorded events. Each recorded event has a position in its stream\n(the "stream position"), and a position in the database (the "commit position").\nStream positions are zero-based and gapless. Commit positions are also zero-based,\nbut are not gapless.\n\nThe methods `append_to_stream()`, `get_stream()` and `read_all()` can\nbe used to read and record in the database.\n\n### Append events\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `append_to_stream()` method can be used atomically to record a sequence of new events.\nIf the operation is successful, it returns the commit position of the last event in the\nsequence that has been recorded.\n\nThis method has three required arguments, `stream_name`, `current_version`\nand `events`.\n\nThe required `stream_name` argument is a Python `str` that uniquely identifies a\nstream to which a sequence of events will be appended.\n\nThe required `current_version` argument is expected to be either a Python `int`\nthat indicates the stream position of the last recorded event in the stream, or\n`StreamState.NO_STREAM` if the stream does not yet exist or has been deleted. The\nstream positions are zero-based and gapless, so that if a stream has two events, the\n`current_version` should be 1. If an incorrect value is given, this method will raise a\n`WrongCurrentVersion` exception. This behavior is designed to provide concurrency\ncontrol when recording new events. The correct value of `current_version` for any stream\ncan be obtained by calling `get_current_version()`. However, the typical approach is to\nreconstruct an aggregate from the recorded events, so that the version of the aggregate\nis the stream position of the last recorded event, then have the aggregate generate new\nevents, and then use the current version of the aggregate as the value of the\n`current_version` argument when appending the new aggregate events. This ensures\nthe consistency of the recorded aggregate events, because operations that generate\nnew aggregate events can be retried with a freshly reconstructed aggregate if\na `WrongCurrentVersion` exception is encountered when recording new events. This\ncontrolling behavior can be disabled by setting the value of the `current_version`\nargument to the constant `StreamState.ANY`.\n\nThe required `events` argument is expected to be a sequence of new event objects. The\n`NewEvent` class should be used to construct new event objects. The `append_to_stream()`\noperation is atomic, so that either all or none of the new events will be recorded. It\nis not possible with EventStoreDB atomically to record new events in more than one stream.\n\nThis method also has an optional `timeout` argument, which is a Python `float`\nthat sets a deadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method also has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nIn the example below, a new event, `event1`, is appended to a new stream. The stream\ndoes not yet exist, so `current_version` is `StreamState.NO_STREAM`.\n\n```python\n# Construct a new event object.\nevent1 = NewEvent(type=\'OrderCreated\', data=b\'data1\')\n\n# Define a new stream name.\nstream_name1 = str(uuid.uuid4())\n\n# Append the new events to the new stream.\ncommit_position1 = client.append_to_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name1,\n    current_version=StreamState.NO_STREAM,\n    events=[event1],\n)\n```\n\nIn the example below, two subsequent events are appended to an existing\nstream. The stream has one recorded event, so `current_version` is `0`.\n\n```python\nevent2 = NewEvent(type=\'OrderUpdated\', data=b\'data2\')\nevent3 = NewEvent(type=\'OrderDeleted\', data=b\'data3\')\n\ncommit_position2 = client.append_to_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name1,\n    current_version=0,\n    events=[event2, event3],\n)\n```\n\nThe returned values, `commit_position1` and `commit_position2`, are the\ncommit positions in the database of the last events in the recorded sequences.\nThat is, `commit_position1` is the commit position of `event1` and\n`commit_position2` is the commit position of `event3`.\n\nCommit positions that are returned in this way can be used by a user interface to poll\na downstream component until it has processed all the newly recorded events. For example,\nconsider a user interface command that results in the recording of new events, and an\neventually consistent materialized view in a downstream component that is updated from\nthese events. If the new events have not yet been processed, the view might be stale,\nor out-of-date. Instead of displaying a stale view, the user interface can poll the\ndownstream component until it has processed the newly recorded events, and then display\nan up-to-date view to the user.\n\n\n### Idempotent append operations\n\nThe `append_to_stream()` method is "idempotent", in that if called with new events whose\n`id` attribute values equal those of recorded events in the named stream immediately\nafter the stream position specified by the value of the `current_version` argument, then\nit will return the commit position of the last new event, without making any changes to\nthe database.\n\nSometimes it may happen, when calling `append_to_stream()`, that the new events are\nsuccessfully recorded but somehow a connection issue occurs before the successful call\ncan return successfully to the client. We cannot be sure if the events were recorded\nor not, and so we may wish to retry. If the events were in fact successfully recorded,\nit is convenient for the retried operation to return successfully without raising an\nexception. If those new events were in fact not recorded, and in the meantime no other\nnew events were recorded in that stream, then it makes sense that the new events will\nbe recorded when the append operation is retried. Of course, if a `WrongCurrentVersion`\nexception is raised when retrying the operation, then an application command which\ngenerated the new events in the context of already recorded events may need to be\nexecuted again. Alternatively, a suitable error might be displayed by the application,\nwith an up-to-date view of the recorded data, giving a user of the application an\nopportunity to decide if they still wish to proceed with their original intention.\n\nThe example below shows the `append_to_stream()` method being called again with\n`event3` and `current_version=0`. We can see that repeating the call to\n`append_to_stream()` returns successfully.\n\n```python\n# Retry appending event3.\ncommit_position_retry = client.append_to_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name1,\n    current_version=0,\n    events=[event2, event3],\n)\n```\n\nWe can see that the same commit position is returned as above.\n\n```python\nassert commit_position_retry == commit_position2\n```\n\nBy calling `get_stream()`, we can also see the stream has been unchanged\ndespite the `append_to_stream()` method having been called twice with the same arguments.\nThat is, there are still only three events in the stream.\n\n```python\nevents = client.get_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name1\n)\n\nassert len(events) == 3\n```\n\nThis idempotent behaviour depends on the `id` attribute of the `NewEvent` class.\nThis attribute, by default, is assigned a new and unique version-4 UUID when an\ninstance of `NewEvent` is constructed. The `id` argument can be used when\nconstructing `NewEvent` objects to set the value of this attribute.\n\n\n### Read stream events\n\nThe `read_stream()` method can be used to get events that have been appended\nto a stream. This method returns a "read response" object.\n\nA "read response" object is a Python iterator. Recorded events can be\nobtained by iterating over the "read response" object. Recorded events are\nstreamed from the server to the client as the iteration proceeds. The iteration\nwill automatically stop when there are no more recorded events to be returned.\nThe streaming of events, and hence the iterator, can also be stopped by calling\nthe `stop()` method on the "read response" object.\n\nThe `get_stream()` method can be used to get events that have been appended\nto a stream. This method returns a Python `tuple` of recorded event objects.\nThe recorded event objects are instances of the `RecordedEvent` class. It\ncalls `read_stream()` and passes the "read response" iterator into a Python\n`tuple`, so that the streaming will complete before the method returns.\n\nThe `read_stream()` and `get_stream()` methods have one required argument, `stream_name`.\n\nThe required `stream_name` argument is a Python `str` that uniquely identifies a\nstream from which recorded events will be returned.\n\nThe `read_stream()` and `get_stream()` methods also have four optional arguments,\n`stream_position`, `backwards`, `limit`, and `timeout`.\n\nThe optional `stream_position` argument is a Python `int` that can be used to\nindicate the position in the stream from which to start reading. The default value\nof `stream_position` is `None`. When reading a stream from a specific position in the\nstream, the recorded event at that position will be included, both when reading\nforwards from that position, and when reading backwards.\n\nThe optional `backwards` argument is a Python `bool`. The default value of `backwards`\nis `False`, which means the stream will be read forwards, so that events are returned\nin the order they were recorded. If `backwards` is `True`, the events are returned in\nreverse order.\n\nIf `backwards` is `False` and `stream_position` is `None`, the stream\'s events will be\nreturned in the order they were recorded, starting from the first recorded event. If\n`backwards` is `True` and `stream_position` is `None`, the stream\'s events will be\nreturned in reverse order, starting from the last recorded event.\n\nThe optional `limit` argument is a Python `int` which restricts the number of events\nthat will be returned. The default value of `limit` is `sys.maxint`.\n\nThe optional `timeout` argument is a Python `float` which sets a deadline for\nthe completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method also has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe example below shows the default behavior, which is to return all the recorded\nevents of a stream forwards from the first recorded events to the last.\n\n```python\nevents = client.get_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name1\n)\n\nassert len(events) == 3\nassert events[0].id == event1.id\nassert events[1].id == event2.id\nassert events[2].id == event3.id\n```\n\nThe example below shows how to use the `stream_position` argument to read a stream\nfrom a specific stream position to the end of the stream. Stream positions are\nzero-based, and so `stream_position=1` corresponds to the second event that was\nrecorded in the stream, in this case `event2`.\n\n```python\nevents = client.get_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name1,\n    stream_position=1,\n)\n\nassert len(events) == 2\nassert events[0].id == event2.id\nassert events[1].id == event3.id\n```\n\nThe example below shows how to use the `backwards` argument to read a stream backwards.\n\n```python\nevents = client.get_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name1,\n    backwards=True,\n)\n\nassert len(events) == 3\nassert events[0].id == event3.id\nassert events[1].id == event2.id\nassert events[2].id == event1.id\n```\n\nThe example below shows how to use the `limit` argument to read a limited number of\nevents.\n\n```python\nevents = client.get_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name1,\n    limit=2,\n)\n\nassert len(events) == 2\nassert events[0].id == event1.id\nassert events[1].id == event2.id\n```\n\nThe `read_stream()` and `get_stream()` methods will raise a `NotFound` exception if the\nnamed stream has never existed or has been deleted.\n\n```python\nfrom esdbclient.exceptions import NotFound\n\n\ntry:\n    client.get_stream(\'does-not-exist\')\nexcept NotFound:\n    pass  # The stream does not exist.\nelse:\n    raise Exception("Shouldn\'t get here")\n```\n\nPlease note, the `get_stream()` method is decorated with the `@autoreconnect` and\n`@retrygrpc` decorators, whilst the `read_stream()` method is not. This means that\nall errors due to connection issues will be caught by the retry and reconnect decorators\nwhen calling the `get_stream()` method, but not when calling `read_stream()`. The\n`read_stream()` method has no such decorators because the streaming only starts\nwhen iterating over the "read response" starts, which means that the method returns\nbefore the streaming starts, and so there is no chance for any decorators to catch\nany connection issues.\n\nFor the same reason, `read_stream()` will not raise a `NotFound` exception when\nthe stream does not exist, until iterating over the "read response" object begins.\n\nIf you are reading a very large stream, then you might prefer to call `read_stream()`,\nand begin iterating through the recorded events whilst they are being streamed from\nthe server, rather than both waiting and having them all accumulate in memory.\n\n### Get current version\n\nThe `get_current_version()` method is a convenience method that essentially calls\n`get_stream()` with `backwards=True` and `limit=1`. This method returns\nthe value of the `stream_position` attribute of the last recorded event in a\nstream. If a stream does not exist, the returned value is `StreamState.NO_STREAM`.\nThe returned value is the correct value of `current_version` when appending events\nto a stream, and when deleting or tombstoning a stream.\n\nThis method has one required argument, `stream_name`.\n\nThe required `stream_name` argument is a Python `str` that uniquely identifies a\nstream from which a stream position will be returned.\n\nThis method also has an optional `timeout` argument, that\nis expected to be a Python `float`, which sets a deadline\nfor the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method also has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nIn the example below, the last stream position of `stream_name1` is obtained.\nSince three events have been appended to `stream_name1`, and because positions\nin a stream are zero-based and gapless, so the current version is `2`.\n\n```python\ncurrent_version = client.get_current_version(\n    stream_name=stream_name1\n)\n\nassert current_version == 2\n```\n\nIf a stream has never existed or has been deleted, the returned value is\n`StreamState.NO_STREAM`, which is the correct value of the `current_version`\nargument both when appending the first event of a new stream, and also when\nappending events to a stream that has been deleted.\n\n```python\ncurrent_version = client.get_current_version(\n    stream_name=\'does-not-exist\'\n)\n\nassert current_version is StreamState.NO_STREAM\n```\n\n### How to implement snapshotting with EventStoreDB\n\nSnapshots can improve the performance of aggregates that would otherwise be\nreconstructed from very long streams. However, it is generally recommended to design\naggregates to have a finite lifecycle, and so to have relatively short streams,\nthereby avoiding the need for snapshotting. This "how to" section is intended merely\nto show how snapshotting of aggregates can be implemented with EventStoreDB using\nthis Python client.\n\nEvent-sourced aggregates are typically reconstructed from recorded events by calling\na mutator function for each recorded event, evolving from an initial state\n`None` to the current state of the aggregate. The function `get_aggregate()` shows\nhow this can be done. The aggregate ID is used as a stream name. The exception\n`AggregateNotFound` is raised if the aggregate stream is not found.\n\n```python\nclass AggregateNotFound(Exception):\n    """Raised when an aggregate is not found."""\n\n\ndef get_aggregate(aggregate_id, mutator_func):\n    stream_name = aggregate_id\n\n    # Get recorded events.\n    try:\n        events = client.get_stream(\n            stream_name=stream_name,\n            stream_position=None\n        )\n    except NotFound as e:\n        raise AggregateNotFound(aggregate_id) from e\n    else:\n        # Reconstruct aggregate from recorded events.\n        aggregate = None\n        for event in events:\n            aggregate = mutator_func(aggregate, event)\n        return aggregate\n```\n\nSnapshotting of aggregates can be implemented by recording the current state of\nan aggregate as a new event.\n\nIf an aggregate object has a version number that corresponds to the stream position of\nthe last event that was used to reconstruct the aggregate, and this version number\nis recorded in the snapshot metadata, then any events that are recorded after the\nsnapshot can be selected using this version number. The aggregate can then be\nreconstructed from the last snapshot and any subsequent events, without having\nto replay the entire history.\n\nWe will use a separate stream for an aggregate\'s snapshots that is named after the\nstream used for recording its events. The name of the snapshot stream will be\nconstructed by prefixing the aggregate\'s stream name with `\'snapshot-$\'`.\n\n```python\nSNAPSHOT_STREAM_NAME_PREFIX = \'snapshot-$\'\n\ndef make_snapshot_stream_name(stream_name):\n    return f\'{SNAPSHOT_STREAM_NAME_PREFIX}{stream_name}\'\n\n\ndef remove_snapshot_stream_prefix(snapshot_stream_name):\n    assert snapshot_stream_name.startswith(SNAPSHOT_STREAM_NAME_PREFIX)\n    return snapshot_stream_name[len(SNAPSHOT_STREAM_NAME_PREFIX):]\n```\n\nNow, let\'s redefine the `get_aggregate()` function, so that it looks for a snapshot event,\nthen selects subsequent aggregate events, and then calls a mutator function for each\nrecorded event.\n\nNotice that the aggregate events are read from a stream for serialized aggregate\nevents, whilst the snapshot is read from a separate stream for serialized aggregate\nsnapshots. We will use JSON to serialize and deserialize event data.\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n\ndef get_aggregate(aggregate_id, mutator_func):\n    stream_name = aggregate_id\n    recorded_events = []\n\n    # Look for a snapshot.\n    try:\n        snapshots = client.get_stream(\n            stream_name=make_snapshot_stream_name(stream_name),\n            backwards=True,\n            limit=1\n        )\n    except NotFound:\n        stream_position = None\n    else:\n        assert len(snapshots) == 1\n        snapshot = snapshots[0]\n        stream_position = deserialize(snapshot.metadata)[\'version\'] + 1\n        recorded_events.append(snapshot)\n\n    # Get subsequent events.\n    try:\n        events = client.get_stream(\n            stream_name=stream_name,\n            stream_position=stream_position\n        )\n    except NotFound as e:\n        raise AggregateNotFound(aggregate_id) from e\n    else:\n        recorded_events += events\n\n    # Reconstruct aggregate from recorded events.\n    aggregate = None\n    for event in recorded_events:\n        aggregate = mutator_func(aggregate, event)\n\n    return aggregate\n\n\ndef serialize(d):\n    return json.dumps(d).encode(\'utf8\')\n\n\ndef deserialize(s):\n    return json.loads(s.decode(\'utf8\'))\n```\n\nTo show how `get_aggregate()` can be used, let\'s define a `Dog` aggregate class, with\nattributes `name` and `tricks`. The attributes `id` and `version` will indicate an\naggregate object\'s ID and version number. The attribute `is_from_snapshot` is added\nhere merely to demonstrate below when an aggregate object has been reconstructed using\na snapshot.\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\nclass Aggregate:\n    id: str\n    version: int\n    is_from_snapshot: bool\n\n\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\nclass Dog(Aggregate):\n    name: str\n    tricks: list\n```\n\nLet\'s also define a mutator function `mutate_dog()` that evolves the state of a\n`Dog` aggregate given various different types of events, `\'DogRegistered\'`,\n`\'DogLearnedTrick\'`, and `\'Snapshot\'`.\n\n```python\ndef mutate_dog(dog, event):\n    data = deserialize(event.data)\n    if event.type == \'DogRegistered\':\n        return Dog(\n            id=event.stream_name,\n            version=event.stream_position,\n            is_from_snapshot=False,\n            name=data[\'name\'],\n            tricks=[],\n        )\n    elif event.type == \'DogLearnedTrick\':\n        assert event.stream_position == dog.version + 1\n        assert event.stream_name == dog.id, (event.stream_name, dog.id)\n        return Dog(\n            id=dog.id,\n            version=event.stream_position,\n            is_from_snapshot=dog.is_from_snapshot,\n            name=dog.name,\n            tricks=dog.tricks + [data[\'trick\']],\n        )\n    elif event.type == \'Snapshot\':\n        return Dog(\n            id=remove_snapshot_stream_prefix(event.stream_name),\n            version=deserialize(event.metadata)[\'version\'],\n            is_from_snapshot=True,\n            name=data[\'name\'],\n            tricks=data[\'tricks\'],\n        )\n    else:\n        raise Exception(f"Unknown event type: {event.type}")\n```\n\nFor convenience, let\'s also define a `get_dog()` function that calls `get_aggregate()`\nwith the `mutate_dog()` function as the value of its `mutator_func` argument.\n\n```python\ndef get_dog(dog_id):\n    return get_aggregate(\n        aggregate_id=dog_id,\n        mutator_func=mutate_dog,\n    )\n```\n\nWe can also define some "command" functions that append new events to the\ndatabase. The `register_dog()` function appends a `DogRegistered` event. The\n`record_trick_learned()` appends a `DogLearnedTrick` event. The function\n`snapshot_dog()` appends a `Snapshot` event. Notice that the\n`record_trick_learned()` and `snapshot_dog()` functions use `get_dog()`.\n\nNotice also that the `DogRegistered` and `DogLearnedTrick` events are appended to a\nstream for aggregate events, whilst the `Snapshot` event is appended to a separate\nstream for aggregate snapshots.\n\n```python\ndef register_dog(name):\n    dog_id = str(uuid.uuid4())\n    event = NewEvent(\n        type=\'DogRegistered\',\n        data=serialize({\'name\': name}),\n    )\n    client.append_to_stream(\n        stream_name=dog_id,\n        current_version=StreamState.NO_STREAM,\n        events=event,\n    )\n    return dog_id\n\n\ndef record_trick_learned(dog_id, trick):\n    dog = get_dog(dog_id)\n    event = NewEvent(\n        type=\'DogLearnedTrick\',\n        data=serialize({\'trick\': trick}),\n    )\n    client.append_to_stream(\n        stream_name=dog_id,\n        current_version=dog.version,\n        events=event,\n    )\n\n\ndef snapshot_dog(dog_id):\n    dog = get_dog(dog_id)\n    event = NewEvent(\n        type=\'Snapshot\',\n        data=serialize({\'name\': dog.name, \'tricks\': dog.tricks}),\n        metadata=serialize({\'version\': dog.version}),\n    )\n    client.append_to_stream(\n        stream_name=make_snapshot_stream_name(dog_id),\n        current_version=StreamState.ANY,\n        events=event,\n    )\n```\n\nWe can call `register_dog()` to register a new dog.\n\n```python\n# Register a new dog.\ndog_id = register_dog(\'Fido\')\n\ndog = get_dog(dog_id)\nassert dog.name == \'Fido\'\nassert dog.tricks == []\nassert dog.version == 0\nassert dog.is_from_snapshot is False\n\n```\n\nWe can call `record_trick_learned()` to record that some tricks have been learned.\n\n```python\n\n# Record that \'Fido\' learned a new trick.\nrecord_trick_learned(dog_id, trick=\'roll over\')\n\ndog = get_dog(dog_id)\nassert dog.name == \'Fido\'\nassert dog.tricks == [\'roll over\']\nassert dog.version == 1\nassert dog.is_from_snapshot is False\n\n\n# Record that \'Fido\' learned another new trick.\nrecord_trick_learned(dog_id, trick=\'fetch ball\')\n\ndog = get_dog(dog_id)\nassert dog.name == \'Fido\'\nassert dog.tricks == [\'roll over\', \'fetch ball\']\nassert dog.version == 2\nassert dog.is_from_snapshot is False\n```\n\nWe can call `snapshot_dog()` to record a snapshot of the current state of the `Dog`\naggregate. After we call `snapshot_dog()`, the `get_dog()` function will return a `Dog`\nobject that has been constructed using the `Snapshot` event.\n\n```python\n# Snapshot \'Fido\'.\nsnapshot_dog(dog_id)\n\ndog = get_dog(dog_id)\nassert dog.name == \'Fido\'\nassert dog.tricks == [\'roll over\', \'fetch ball\']\nassert dog.version == 2\nassert dog.is_from_snapshot is True\n```\n\nWe can continue to evolve the state of the `Dog` aggregate, using\nthe snapshot both during the call to `record_trick_learned()` and\nwhen calling `get_dog()` directly.\n\n```python\nrecord_trick_learned(dog_id, trick=\'sit\')\n\ndog = get_dog(dog_id)\nassert dog.name == \'Fido\'\nassert dog.tricks == [\'roll over\', \'fetch ball\', \'sit\']\nassert dog.version == 3\nassert dog.is_from_snapshot is True\n```\n\nWe can see from the `is_from_snapshot` attribute that the `Dog` object was indeed\nreconstructed from the snapshot.\n\nSnapshots can be created at fixed version number intervals, fixed time\nperiods, after a particular type of event, immediately after events are\nappended, or as a background process.\n\n\n### Read all events\n\nThe `read_all()` method can be used to get all recorded events\nin the database in the order they were recorded. This method returns\na "read response" object, just like `read_stream()`.\n\nA "read response" is an iterator, and not a sequence. Recorded events can be\nobtained by iterating over the "read response" object. Recorded events are\nstreamed from the server to the client as the iteration proceeds. The iteration\nwill automatically stop when there are no more recorded events to be returned.\nThe streaming of events, and hence the iterator, can also be stopped by calling\nthe `stop()` method on the "read response" object. The recorded event objects\nare instances of the `RecordedEvent` class.\n\nThis method has eight optional arguments, `commit_position`, `backwards`,\n`filter_exclude`, `filter_include`, `filter_by_stream_name`, `limit`, `timeout`,\nand `credentials`.\n\nThe optional `commit_position` argument is a Python `int` that can be used to\nspecify a commit position from which to start reading. The default value of\n`commit_position` is `None`. Please note, if a commit position is specified,\nit must be an actually existing commit position in the database. When reading\nforwards, the event at the commit position may be included, depending upon the\nfilter. When reading backwards, the event at the commit position will not be\nincluded.\n\nThe optional `backwards` argument is a Python `bool`. The default of `backwards` is\n`False`, which means events are returned in the order they were recorded, If\n`backwards` is `True`, then events are returned in reverse order.\n\nIf `backwards` is `False` and `commit_position` is `None`, the database\'s events will\nbe returned in the order they were recorded, starting from the first recorded event.\nThis is the default behavior of `read_all()`. If `backwards` is `True` and\n`commit_position` is `None`, the database\'s events will be returned in reverse order,\nstarting from the last recorded event.\n\nThe optional `filter_exclude` argument is a sequence of regular expressions that\nspecifies which recorded events should be returned. This argument is ignored\nif `filter_include` is set to a non-empty sequence. The default value of this\nargument matches the event types of EventStoreDB "system events", so that system\nevents will not normally be included. See the Notes section below for more\ninformation about filter expressions.\n\nThe optional `filter_include` argument is a sequence of regular expressions\nthat specifies which recorded events should be returned. By default, this\nargument is an empty tuple. If this argument is set to a non-empty sequence,\nthe `filter_exclude` argument is ignored.\n\nThe optional `filter_by_stream_name` argument is a Python `bool` that indicates\nwhether the filtering will apply to event types or stream names. By default, this\nvalue is `False` and so the filtering will apply to the event type strings of\nrecorded events.\n\nThe optional `limit` argument is an integer which restricts the number of events that\nwill be returned. The default value is `sys.maxint`.\n\nThe optional `timeout` argument is a Python `float` which sets a\ndeadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThe optional `credentials` argument can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe filtering of events is done on the EventStoreDB server. The\n`limit` argument is applied on the server after filtering.\n\nThe example below shows how to get all the events we have recorded in the database\nso far, in the order they were recorded. We can see the three events of `stream_name1`\n(`event1`, `event2` and `event3`) are included, along with others.\n\n```python\n# Read all events (creates a streaming gRPC call).\nread_response = client.read_all()\n\n# Convert the iterator into a sequence of recorded events.\nevents = tuple(read_response)\nassert len(events) > 3  # more than three\n\n# Convert the sequence of recorded events into a set of event IDs.\nevent_ids = set(e.id for e in events)\nassert event1.id in event_ids\nassert event2.id in event_ids\nassert event3.id in event_ids\n```\n\nThe example below shows how to read all recorded events in the database from\na particular commit position, in this case `commit_position1`. When reading\nforwards from a specific commit position, the event at the specified position\nwill be included. The value of `commit_position1` is the position we obtained\nwhen appending `event1`. And so `event1` is the first recorded event we shall\nreceive, `event2` is the second, and `event3` is the third.\n\n```python\n# Read all events forwards from a commit position.\nread_response = client.read_all(\n    commit_position=commit_position1\n)\n\n# Step through the "read response" iterator.\nassert next(read_response).id == event1.id\nassert next(read_response).id == event2.id\nassert next(read_response).id == event3.id\n\n# Stop the iterator.\nread_response.stop()\n```\n\nThe example below shows how to read all events recorded in the database in reverse\norder. We can see that the first events we receive are the last events that were\nrecorded: the events of the `Dog` aggregate from the section about snapshotting\nand the snapshot.\n\n```python\n# Read all events backwards from the end.\nread_response = client.read_all(\n    backwards=True\n)\n\n# Step through the "read response" iterator.\nassert next(read_response).type == "DogLearnedTrick"\nassert next(read_response).type == "Snapshot"\nassert next(read_response).type == "DogLearnedTrick"\nassert next(read_response).type == "DogLearnedTrick"\nassert next(read_response).type == "DogRegistered"\n\n# Stop the iterator.\nread_response.stop()\n```\n\nThe example below shows how to read a limited number of events\nforwards from a specific commit position.\n\n```python\nevents = tuple(\n    client.read_all(\n        commit_position=commit_position1,\n        limit=1,\n    )\n)\n\nassert len(events) == 1\nassert events[0].id == event1.id\n```\n\nThe example below shows how to read a limited number of the recorded events\nin the database backwards from the end. In this case, the limit is 1, and\nso we receive the last recorded event.\n\n```python\nevents = tuple(\n    client.read_all(\n        backwards=True,\n        limit=1,\n    )\n)\n\nassert len(events) == 1\n\nassert events[0].type == \'DogLearnedTrick\'\nassert deserialize(events[0].data)[\'trick\'] == \'sit\'\n```\n\nPlease note, like the `read_stream()` method, the `read_all()` method\nis not decorated with retry and reconnect decorators, because the streaming of recorded\nevents from the server only starts when iterating over the "read response" starts, which\nmeans that the method returns before the streaming starts, and so there is no chance for\nany decorators to catch any connection issues.\n\n### Get commit position\n\nThe `get_commit_position()` method can be used to get the commit position of the\nlast recorded event in the database. It simply calls `read_all()` with\n`backwards=True` and `limit=1`, and returns the value of the `commit_position`\nattribute of the last recorded event.\n\n```python\ncommit_position = client.get_commit_position()\n```\n\nThis method has five optional arguments, `filter_exclude`, `filter_include`,\n`filter_by_stream_name`, `timeout` and `credentials`. These values are passed to\n`read_all()`.\n\nThe optional `filter_exclude`, `filter_include` and `filter_by_stream_name` arguments\nwork in the same way as they do in the `read_all()` method.\n\nThe optional `timeout` argument is a Python `float` that sets\na deadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThe optional `credentials` argument can be used to override call credentials\nderived from the connection string URI.\n\nThis method might be used to measure progress of a downstream component\nthat is processing all recorded events, by comparing the current commit\nposition with the recorded commit position of the last successfully processed\nevent in a downstream component. In this case, the value of the `filter_exclude`,\n`filter_include` and `filter_by_stream_name` arguments should equal those used\nby the downstream component to obtain recorded events.\n\n\n### Get stream metadata\n\nThe `get_stream_metadata()` method returns the metadata for a stream, along\nwith the version of the stream metadata.\n\nThis method has one required argument, `stream_name`, which is a Python `str` that\nuniquely identifies a stream for which a stream metadata will be obtained.\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, which is a Python `float` that sets\na deadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nIn the example below, metadata for `stream_name1` is obtained.\n\n```python\nmetadata, metadata_version = client.get_stream_metadata(stream_name=stream_name1)\n```\n\nThe returned `metadata` value is a Python `dict`. The returned `metadata_version`\nvalue is either an `int` if the stream exists, or `StreamState.NO_STREAM` if the stream\ndoes not exist and no metadata has been set. These values can be used as the arguments\nof `set_stream_metadata()`.\n\n### Set stream metadata\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe method `set_stream_metadata()` sets metadata for a stream. Stream metadata\ncan be set before appending events to a stream.\n\nThis method has one required argument, `stream_name`, which is a Python `str` that\nuniquely identifies a stream for which a stream metadata will be set.\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, which is a Python `float` that sets\na deadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nIn the example below, metadata for `stream_name1` is set.\n\n\n```python\nmetadata["foo"] = "bar"\n\nclient.set_stream_metadata(\n    stream_name=stream_name1,\n    metadata=metadata,\n    current_version=metadata_version,\n)\n```\n\nThe `current_version` argument should be the current version of the stream metadata\nobtained from `get_stream_metadata()`.\n\nPlease refer to the EventStoreDB documentation for more information about stream\nmetadata.\n\n### Delete stream\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe method `delete_stream()` can be used to "delete" a stream.\n\nThis method has two required arguments, `stream_name` and `current_version`.\n\nThe required `stream_name` argument is a Python `str` that uniquely identifies a\nstream to which a sequence of events will be appended.\n\nThe required `current_version` argument is expected to be either a Python `int`\nthat indicates the stream position of the last recorded event in the stream.\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, which is a Python `float` that sets\na deadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nIn the example below, `stream_name1` is deleted.\n\n```python\ncommit_position = client.delete_stream(stream_name=stream_name1, current_version=2)\n```\n\nAfter deleting a stream, it\'s still possible to append new events. Reading from a\ndeleted stream will return only events that have been appended after it was\ndeleted.\n\n### Tombstone stream\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe method `tombstone_stream()` can be used to "tombstone" a stream.\n\nThis method has two required arguments, `stream_name` and `current_version`.\n\nThe required `stream_name` argument is a Python `str` that uniquely identifies a\nstream to which a sequence of events will be appended.\n\nThe required `current_version` argument is expected to be either a Python `int`\nthat indicates the stream position of the last recorded event in the stream.\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, which is a Python `float` that sets\na deadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nIn the example below, `stream_name1` is tombstoned.\n\n```python\ncommit_position = client.tombstone_stream(stream_name=stream_name1, current_version=2)\n```\n\nAfter tombstoning a stream, it\'s not possible to append new events.\n\n\n## Catch-up subscriptions\n\nA "catch-up" subscription can be used to receive events that have already been\nrecorded and events that are recorded subsequently. A catch-up subscription can\nbe used by an event-processing component that processes recorded events with\n"exactly-once" semantics.\n\nThe `subscribe_to_all()` method starts a catch-up subscription that can receive\nall events in the database. The `subscribe_to_stream()` method starts a catch-up\nsubscription that can receive events from a specific stream. Both methods return a\n"catch-up subscription" object, which is a Python iterator. Recorded events can be\nobtained by iteration. Recorded event objects obtained in this way are instances\nof the `RecordedEvent` class.\n\nBefore the "catch-up subscription" object is returned to the caller, the client will\nfirstly obtain a "confirmation" response from the server, which allows the client to\ndetect that both the gRPC connection and the streaming gRPC call is operational. For\nthis reason, the `subscribe_to_all()` and `subscribe_to_stream()` methods are both\nusefully decorated with the reconnect and retry decorators. However, once the method\nhas returned, the decorators will have exited, and any exceptions that are raised\ndue to connection issues whilst iterating over the subscription object will have to\nbe handled by your code.\n\nA "catch-up subscription" iterator will not automatically stop when there are no more\nevents to be returned, but instead the iteration will block until new events are\nsubsequently recorded in the database. Any subsequently recorded events will then be\nimmediately streamed to the client, and the iteration will then continue. The streaming\nof events, and hence the iteration, can be stopped by calling the `stop()` method on the\n"catch-up subscription" object.\n\n### Subscribe to all events\n\nThe`subscribe_to_all()` method can be used to start a catch-up subscription\nfrom which all events recorded in the database can be obtained in the order\nthey were recorded. This method returns a "catch-up subscription" iterator.\n\nThis method also has six optional arguments, `commit_position`, `filter_exclude`,\n`filter_include`, `filter_by_stream_name`, `timeout` and `credentials`.\n\nThe optional `commit_position` argument specifies a commit position. The default\nvalue of `commit_position` is `None`, which means the catch-up subscription will\nstart from the first recorded event in the database. If a commit position is given,\nit must match an actually existing commit position in the database. Only events\nrecorded after that position will be obtained.\n\nThe optional `filter_exclude` argument is a sequence of regular expressions that\nspecifies which recorded events should be returned. This argument is ignored\nif `filter_include` is set to a non-empty sequence. The default value of this\nargument matches the event types of EventStoreDB "system events", so that system\nevents will not normally be included. See the Notes section below for more\ninformation about filter expressions.\n\nThe optional `filter_include` argument is a sequence of regular expressions\nthat specifies which recorded events should be returned. By default, this\nargument is an empty tuple. If this argument is set to a non-empty sequence,\nthe `filter_exclude` argument is ignored.\n\nThe optional `filter_by_stream_name` argument is a Python `bool` that indicates\nwhether the filtering will apply to event types or stream names. By default, this\nvalue is `False` and so the filtering will apply to the event type strings of\nrecorded events.\n\nThe optional `timeout` argument is a Python `float` which sets a\ndeadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThe optional `credentials` argument can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe example below shows how to start a catch-up subscription that starts\nfrom the first recorded event in the database.\n\n```python\n# Subscribe from the first recorded event in the database.\ncatchup_subscription = client.subscribe_to_all()\n```\n\nThe example below shows that catch-up subscriptions do not stop\nautomatically, but block when the last recorded event is received,\nand then continue when subsequent events are recorded.\n\n```python\nfrom time import sleep\nfrom threading import Thread\n\n\n# Append a new event to a new stream.\nstream_name2 = str(uuid.uuid4())\nevent4 = NewEvent(type=\'OrderCreated\', data=b\'data4\')\n\nclient.append_to_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n    current_version=StreamState.NO_STREAM,\n    events=[event4],\n)\n\n\n# Receive events from the catch-up subscription in a different thread.\nreceived_events = []\n\ndef receive_events():\n    for event in catchup_subscription:\n        received_events.append(event)\n\n\ndef wait_for_event(event_id):\n    for _ in range(100):\n        for event in reversed(received_events):\n            if event.id == event_id:\n                return\n        else:\n            sleep(0.1)\n    else:\n        raise AssertionError("Event wasn\'t received")\n\n\nthread = Thread(target=receive_events, daemon=True)\nthread.start()\n\n# Wait to receive event4.\nwait_for_event(event4.id)\n\n# Append another event whilst the subscription is running.\nevent5 = NewEvent(type=\'OrderUpdated\', data=b\'data5\')\nclient.append_to_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n    current_version=0,\n    events=[event5],\n)\n\n# Wait for the subscription to block.\nwait_for_event(event5.id)\n\n# Stop the subscription.\ncatchup_subscription.stop()\nthread.join()\n```\n\nThe example below shows how to subscribe to events recorded after a\nparticular commit position, in this case from the commit position of\nthe last recorded event that was received above. Another event is\nrecorded before the subscription is restarted. Further events are\nrecorded whilst the subscription is running. The events we appended\nare received in the order they were recorded.\n\n\n```python\n\n# Append another event.\nevent6 = NewEvent(type=\'OrderDeleted\', data=b\'data6\')\nclient.append_to_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n    current_version=1,\n    events=[event6],\n)\n\n# Restart subscribing to all events after the\n# commit position of the last received event.\ncatchup_subscription = client.subscribe_to_all(\n    commit_position=received_events[-1].commit_position\n)\n\nthread = Thread(target=receive_events, daemon=True)\nthread.start()\n\n# Wait for event6.\nwait_for_event(event6.id)\n\n# Append three more events to a new stream.\nstream_name3 = str(uuid.uuid4())\nevent7 = NewEvent(type=\'OrderCreated\', data=b\'data7\')\nevent8 = NewEvent(type=\'OrderUpdated\', data=b\'data8\')\nevent9 = NewEvent(type=\'OrderDeleted\', data=b\'data9\')\n\nclient.append_to_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name3,\n    current_version=StreamState.NO_STREAM,\n    events=[event7, event8, event9],\n)\n\n# Wait for events.\nwait_for_event(event7.id)\nwait_for_event(event8.id)\nwait_for_event(event9.id)\n\n# Stop the subscription.\ncatchup_subscription.stop()\nthread.join()\n```\n\nThe catch-up subscription call is ended as soon as the subscription object\'s\n`stop()` method is called. This happens automatically when it goes out of scope,\nor when it is explicitly deleted from memory using the Python `del` keyword.\n\n### Subscribe to stream events\n\nThe `subscribe_to_stream()` method can be used to start a catch-up subscription\nfrom which events recorded in a single stream can be obtained. This method\nreturns a "catch-up subscription" iterator.\n\nThis method has a required `stream_name` argument, which specifies the name of the\nstream from which recorded events will be received.\n\nThis method also has three optional arguments, `stream_position`, `timeout` and `credentials`.\n\nThe optional `stream_position` argument specifies a position in the stream. The\ndefault value of `stream_position` is `None`, which means that all events\nrecorded in the stream will be obtained in the order they were recorded.\nIf a stream position is given, then only events recorded after that position\nwill be obtained.\n\nThe optional `timeout` argument is a Python `float` that sets\na deadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThe optional `credentials` argument can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe example below shows how to start a catch-up subscription from\nthe first recorded event in a stream.\n\n```python\n# Subscribe from the start of \'stream2\'.\nsubscription = client.subscribe_to_stream(stream_name=stream_name2)\n```\n\nThe example below shows how to start a catch-up subscription from\na particular stream position.\n\n```python\n# Subscribe to stream2, from the second recorded event.\nsubscription = client.subscribe_to_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n    stream_position=1,\n)\n```\n\n### How to implement exactly-once event processing\n\nThe commit positions of recorded events that are received and processed by a\ndownstream component are usefully recorded by the downstream component, so that\nthe commit position of last processed event can be determined when processing is\nresumed.\n\nThe last recorded commit position can be used to specify the commit position from which\nto subscribe when processing is resumed. Since this commit position will represent the\nposition of the last successfully processed event in a downstream component, so it\nwill be usual to want the next event after this position, because that is the next\nevent that has not yet been processed. For this reason, when subscribing for events\nfrom a specific commit position using a catch-up subscription in EventStoreDB, the\nrecorded event at the specified commit position will NOT be included in the sequence\nof recorded events that are received.\n\nTo accomplish "exactly-once" processing of recorded events in a downstream\ncomponent when using a catch-up subscription, the commit position of a recorded\nevent should be recorded atomically and uniquely along with the result of processing\nrecorded events, for example in the same database as materialised views when\nimplementing eventually-consistent CQRS, or in the same database as a downstream\nanalytics or reporting or archiving application. By recording the commit position\nof recorded events atomically with the new state that results from processing\nrecorded events, "dual writing" in the consumption of recorded events can be\navoided. By also recording the commit position uniquely, the new state cannot be\nrecorded twice, and hence the recorded state of the downstream component will be\nupdated only once for any recorded event. By using the greatest recorded commit\nposition to resume a catch-up subscription, all recorded events will eventually\nbe processed. The combination of the "at-most-once" condition and the "at-least-once"\ncondition gives the "exactly-once" condition.\n\nThe danger with "dual writing" in the consumption of recorded events is that if a\nrecorded event is successfully processed and new state recorded atomically in one\ntransaction with the commit position recorded in a separate transaction, one may\nhappen and not the other. If the new state is recorded but the position is lost,\nand then the processing is stopped and resumed, the recorded event may be processed\ntwice. On the other hand, if the commit position is recorded but the new state is\nlost, the recorded event may effectively not be processed at all. By either\nprocessing an event more than once, or by failing to process an event, the recorded\nstate of the downstream component might be inaccurate, or possibly inconsistent, and\nperhaps catastrophically so. Such consequences may or may not matter in your situation.\nBut sometimes inconsistencies may halt processing until the issue is resolved. You can\navoid "dual writing" in the consumption of events by atomically recording the commit\nposition of a recorded event along with the new state that results from processing that\nevent in the same atomic transaction. By making the recording of the commit positions\nunique, so that transactions will be rolled back when there is a conflict, you will\nprevent the results of any duplicate processing of a recorded event being committed.\n\nRecorded events received from a catch-up subscription cannot be acknowledged back\nto the EventStoreDB server. Acknowledging events, however, is an aspect of "persistent\nsubscriptions". Hoping to rely on acknowledging events to an upstream\ncomponent is an example of dual writing.\n\n\n## Persistent subscriptions\n\nIn EventStoreDB, "persistent" subscriptions are similar to catch-up subscriptions,\nin that reading a persistent subscription will block when there are no more recorded\nevents to be received, and then continue when new events are subsequently recorded.\n\nPersistent subscriptions can\n\nPersistent subscriptions can be consumed by a group of consumers operating with one\nof the supported "consumer strategies".\n\nThe significant different with persistent subscriptions is the server will keep track\nof the progress of the consumers. The consumer of a persistent subscription will\ntherefore need to "acknowledge" when a recorded event has been processed successfully,\nand otherwise "negatively acknowledge" a recorded event that has been received but was\nnot successfully processed.\n\nAll of this means that for persistent subscriptions there are "create", "read", "update"\n"delete", "ack", and "nack" operations to consider.\n\nWhilst there are some advantages of persistent subscriptions, in particular the\nconcurrent processing of recorded events by a group of consumers, by tracking in\nthe server the position in the commit sequence of events that have been processed,\nthe issue of "dual writing" in the consumption of events arises. Reliability in the\nprocessing of recorded events by a group of persistent subscription consumers will\nrely on their idempotent handling of duplicate messages, and their resilience to\nout-of-order delivery.\n\n\n### Create subscription to all\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `create_subscription_to_all()` method can be used to create a "persistent subscription"\nto all the recorded events in the database across all streams.\n\nThis method has a required `group_name` argument, which is the\nname of a "group" of consumers of the subscription.\n\nThis method also has eight optional arguments, `from_end`, `commit_position`,\n`filter_exclude`, `filter_include`, `filter_by_stream_name`, `consumer_strategy`,\n`timeout` and `credentials`.\n\nThe optional `from_end` argument can be used to specify that the group of consumers\nof the subscription should only receive events that were recorded after the subscription\nwas created.\n\nAlternatively, the optional `commit_position` argument can be used to specify a commit\nposition from which commit position the group of consumers of the subscription should\nreceive events. Please note, the recorded event at the specified commit position might\nbe included in the recorded events received by the group of consumers.\n\nIf neither `from_end` or `commit_position` are specified, the group of consumers\nof the subscription will potentially receive all recorded events in the database.\n\nThe optional `filter_exclude` argument is a sequence of regular expressions that\nspecifies which recorded events should be returned. This argument is ignored\nif `filter_include` is set to a non-empty sequence. The default value of this\nargument matches the event types of EventStoreDB "system events", so that system\nevents will not normally be included. See the Notes section below for more\ninformation about filter expressions.\n\nThe optional `filter_include` argument is a sequence of regular expressions\nthat specifies which recorded events should be returned. By default, this\nargument is an empty tuple. If this argument is set to a non-empty sequence,\nthe `filter_exclude` argument is ignored.\n\nThe optional `filter_by_stream_name` argument is a Python `bool` that indicates\nwhether the filtering will apply to event types or stream names. By default, this\nvalue is `False` and so the filtering will apply to the event type strings of\nrecorded events.\n\nThe optional `consumer_strategy` argument is a Python `str` that defines\nthe consumer strategy for this persistent subscription. The value of this argument\ncan be `\'DispatchToSingle\'`, `\'RoundRobin\'`, `\'Pinned\'`, or `\'PinnedByCorrelation\'`. The\ndefault value is `\'DispatchToSingle\'`.\n\nThe optional `timeout` argument is a Python `float` which sets a\ndeadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThe optional `credentials` argument can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe method `create_subscription_to_all()` does not return a value. Recorded events are\nobtained by calling the `read_subscription_to_all()` method.\n\nIn the example below, a persistent subscription is created to operate from the\nfirst recorded non-system event in the database.\n\n```python\n# Create a persistent subscription.\ngroup_name1 = f"group-{uuid.uuid4()}"\nclient.create_subscription_to_all(group_name=group_name1)\n```\n\n### Read subscription to all\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `read_subscription_to_all()` method can be used by a group of consumers to receive\nrecorded events from a persistent subscription that has been created using\nthe `create_subscription_to_all()` method.\n\nThis method has a required `group_name` argument, which is\nthe name of a "group" of consumers of the subscription specified\nwhen `create_subscription_to_all()` was called.\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, that\nis expected to be a Python `float`, which sets a deadline\nfor the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method also has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThis method returns a `PersistentSubscription` object, which is an iterator\ngiving `RecordedEvent` objects. It also has `ack()`, `nack()` and `stop()`\nmethods.\n\n```python\nsubscription = client.read_subscription_to_all(group_name=group_name1)\n```\n\nThe `ack()` method should be used by a consumer to indicate to the server that it\nhas received and successfully processed a recorded event. This will prevent that\nrecorded event being received by another consumer in the same group. The `ack()`\nmethod takes an `event_id` argument, which is the ID of the recorded event that\nhas been received.\n\nThe example below iterates over the subscription object, and calls `ack()`. The\n`stop()` method is called when we have received the last event, so that we can\ncontinue with the examples below.\n\n```python\nreceived_events = []\n\nfor event in subscription:\n    received_events.append(event)\n\n    # Acknowledge the received event.\n    subscription.ack(event_id=event.id)\n\n    # Stop when \'event9\' has been received.\n    if event.id == event9.id:\n        subscription.stop()\n```\n\nThe events are not guaranteed to be received in the order they were recorded. But\nwe will have received `event9`.\n\n```python\nassert event9.id in [e.id for e in received_events]\n```\n\nThe `PersistentSubscription` object also has an `nack()` method that should be used\nby a consumer to negatively acknowledge to the server that it has received but not\nsuccessfully processed a recorded event. The `nack()` method has an `event_id`\nargument, which is the ID of the recorded event that has been received. The `nack()`\nmethod also has an `action` argument, which should be a Python `str`: either\n`\'unknown\'`, `\'park\'`, `\'retry\'`, `\'skip\'` or `\'stop\'`.\n\n\n### How to write a persistent subscription consumer\n\nThe reading of a persistent subscription can be encapsulated in a "consumer" that calls\na "policy" function when a recorded event is received and then automatically calls\n`ack()` if the policy function returns normally, and `nack()` if it raises an exception,\nperhaps retrying the event for a certain number of times before parking the event.\n\nThe simple example below shows how this might be done. We can see that \'event9\' is\nacknowledged before \'event5\' is finally parked.\n\n\n```python\nacked_events = {}\nnacked_events = {}\n\n\nclass ExampleConsumer:\n    def __init__(self, subscription, max_retries, final_action):\n        self.subscription = subscription\n        self.max_retries = max_retries\n        self.final_action = final_action\n        self.error = None\n\n    def run(self):\n        try:\n            for event in self.subscription:\n                try:\n                    self.policy(event)\n                except Exception:\n                    if event.retry_count < self.max_retries:\n                        action = "retry"\n                    else:\n                        action = self.final_action\n                    self.subscription.nack(event.id, action=action)\n                    self.after_nack(event, action)\n                else:\n                    self.subscription.ack(event.id)\n                    self.after_ack(event)\n        except Exception:\n            self.stop()\n            raise\n\n    def stop(self):\n        self.subscription.stop()\n\n    def policy(self, event):\n        # Raise an exception when we see "event5".\n        if event.id == event5.id:\n            raise Exception()\n\n    def after_ack(self, event):\n        # Track retry count of acked events.\n        acked_events[event.id] = event.retry_count\n\n    def after_nack(self, event, action):\n        # Track retry count of nacked events.\n        nacked_events[event.id] = event.retry_count\n\n        if action == self.final_action:\n            # Stop the consumer, so we can continue with the examples.\n            self.stop()\n\n\n# Create subscription.\ngroup_name = f"group-{uuid.uuid4()}"\nclient.create_subscription_to_all(group_name, commit_position=commit_position1)\n\n# Read subscription.\nsubscription = client.read_subscription_to_all(group_name)\n\n# Construct consumer.\nconsumer = ExampleConsumer(\n    subscription=subscription,\n    max_retries=5,\n    final_action="park",\n)\n\n# Run consumer.\nconsumer.run()\n\n# Check \'event5\' was nacked and never acked.\nassert event5.id in nacked_events\nassert event5.id not in acked_events\nassert nacked_events[event5.id] == 5\n\n# Check \'event9\' was acked and never nacked.\nassert event9.id in acked_events\nassert event9.id not in nacked_events\n```\n\n### Update subscription to all\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `update_subscription_to_all()` method can be used to update a\n"persistent subscription".\n\nThis method has a required `group_name` argument, which is the\nname of a "group" of consumers of the subscription.\n\nThis method also has three optional arguments, `from_end`, `commit_position`, `timeout`\nand `credentials`.\n\nThe optional `from_end` argument can be used to specify that the group of consumers\nof the subscription should only receive events that were recorded after the subscription\nwas updated.\n\nAlternatively, the optional `commit_position` argument can be used to specify a commit\nposition from which commit position the group of consumers of the subscription should\nreceive events. Please note, the recorded event at the specified commit position might\nbe included in the recorded events received by the group of consumers.\n\nIf neither `from_end` or `commit_position` are specified, the group of consumers\nof the subscription will potentially receive all recorded events in the database.\n\nPlease note, the filter options and consumer strategy cannot be adjusted.\n\nThe optional `timeout` argument is a Python `float` which sets a\ndeadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThe optional `credentials` argument can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe method `update_subscription_to_all()` does not return a value.\n\nIn the example below, a persistent subscription is updated to run from the end of the\ndatabase.\n\n```python\n# Create a persistent subscription.\nclient.update_subscription_to_all(group_name=group_name1, from_end=True)\n```\n\n### Create subscription to stream\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `create_subscription_to_stream()` method can be used to create a persistent\nsubscription to a stream.\n\nThis method has two required arguments, `group_name` and `stream_name`. The\n`group_name` argument names the group of consumers that will receive events\nfrom this subscription. The `stream_name` argument specifies which stream\nthe subscription will follow. The values of both these arguments are expected\nto be Python `str` objects.\n\nThis method also has five optional arguments, `stream_position`, `from_end`,\n`consumer_strategy`, `timeout` and `credentials`.\n\nThe optional `stream_position` argument specifies a stream position from\nwhich to subscribe. The recorded event at this stream\nposition will be received when reading the subscription.\n\nThe optional `from_end` argument is a Python `bool`.\nBy default, the value of this argument is `False`. If this argument is set\nto `True`, reading from the subscription will receive only events\nrecorded after the subscription was created. That is, it is not inclusive\nof the current stream position.\n\nThe optional `consumer_strategy` argument is a Python `str` that defines\nthe consumer strategy for this persistent subscription. The value of this argument\ncan be `\'DispatchToSingle\'`, `\'RoundRobin\'`, `\'Pinned\'`, or `\'PinnedByCorrelation\'`. The\ndefault value is `\'DispatchToSingle\'`.\n\nThe optional `timeout` argument is a Python `float` which sets a deadline\nfor the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThe optional `credentials` argument can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThis method does not return a value. Events can be received by calling\n`read_subscription_to_stream()`.\n\nThe example below creates a persistent stream subscription from the start of the stream.\n\n```python\n# Create a persistent stream subscription from start of the stream.\ngroup_name2 = f"group-{uuid.uuid4()}"\nclient.create_subscription_to_stream(\n    group_name=group_name2,\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n)\n```\n\n### Read subscription to stream\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `read_subscription_to_stream()` method can be used to read a persistent\nsubscription to a stream.\n\nThis method has two required arguments, `group_name` and `stream_name`, which\nshould match the values of arguments used when calling `create_subscription_to_stream()`.\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, that\nis expected to be a Python `float`, which sets a deadline\nfor the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method also has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThis method returns a `PersistentSubscription` object, which is an iterator\ngiving `RecordedEvent` objects, that also has `ack()`, `nack()` and `stop()`\nmethods.\n\n```python\nsubscription = client.read_subscription_to_stream(\n    group_name=group_name2,\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n)\n```\n\nThe example below iterates over the subscription object, and calls `ack()`.\nThe for loop breaks when we have received the last event in the stream, so\nthat we can finish the examples in this documentation.\n\n```python\nevents = []\nfor event in subscription:\n    events.append(event)\n\n    # Acknowledge the received event.\n    subscription.ack(event_id=event.id)\n\n    # Stop when \'event6\' has been received.\n    if event.id == event6.id:\n        subscription.stop()\n```\n\nWe can check we received all the events that were appended to `stream_name2`\nin the examples above.\n\n```python\nassert len(events) == 3\nassert events[0].stream_name == stream_name2\nassert events[0].id == event4.id\nassert events[1].stream_name == stream_name2\nassert events[1].id == event5.id\nassert events[2].stream_name == stream_name2\nassert events[2].id == event6.id\n```\n\n### Update subscription to stream\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `update_subscription_to_stream()` method can be used to update a\npersistent subscription to a stream.\n\nThis method has a required `group_name` argument, which is the\nname of a "group" of consumers of the subscription, and a required\n`stream_name` argument, which is the name of a stream.\n\nThis method also has four optional arguments, `from_end`, `stream_position`,\n`timeout` and `credentials`.\n\nThe optional `from_end` argument can be used to specify that the group of consumers\nof the subscription should only receive events that were recorded after the subscription\nwas updated.\n\nAlternatively, the optional `stream_position` argument can be used to specify a stream\nposition from which commit position the group of consumers of the subscription should\nreceive events. Please note, the recorded event at the specified stream position might\nbe included in the recorded events received by the group of consumers.\n\nIf neither `from_end` or `commit_position` are specified, the group of consumers\nof the subscription will potentially receive all recorded events in the stream.\n\nPlease note, the consumer strategy cannot be adjusted.\n\nThe optional `timeout` argument is a Python `float` which sets a\ndeadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThe optional `credentials` argument can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe `update_subscription_to_stream()` method does not return a value.\n\nIn the example below, a persistent subscription to a stream is updated to run from the\nend of the stream.\n\n```python\n# Create a persistent subscription.\nclient.update_subscription_to_stream(\n    group_name=group_name2,\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n    from_end=True,\n)\n```\n\n### Replay parked events\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `replay_parked_events()` method can be used to "replay" events that have\nbeen "parked" (negatively acknowledged with the action `\'park\'`) when reading\na persistent subscription. Parked events will then be received again by consumers\nreading from the persistent subscription.\n\nThis method has a required `group_name` argument and an optional `stream_name`\nargument. The values of these arguments should match those used when calling\n`create_subscription_to_all()` or `create_subscription_to_stream()`.\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, that\nis expected to be a Python `float`, which sets a deadline\nfor the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method also has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe example below replays parked events for group `group_name1`.\n\n```python\nclient.replay_parked_events(\n    group_name=group_name1,\n)\n```\n\nThe example below replays parked events for group `group_name2`.\n\n```python\nclient.replay_parked_events(\n    group_name=group_name2,\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n)\n```\n\n### Get subscription info\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `get_subscription_info()` method can be used to get information for a\npersistent subscription.\n\nThis method has a required `group_name` argument and an optional `stream_name`\nargument, which should match the values of arguments used when calling either\n`create_subscription_to_all()` or `create_subscription_to_stream()`.\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, that\nis expected to be a Python `float`, which sets a deadline\nfor the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method also has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe example below gets information for the persistent subscription `group_name1` which\nwas created by calling `create_subscription_to_all()`.\n\n```python\nsubscription_info = client.get_subscription_info(\n    group_name=group_name1,\n)\n```\n\nThe example below gets information for the persistent subscription `group_name2` on\n`stream_name2` which was created by calling `create_subscription_to_stream()`.\n\n```python\nsubscription_info = client.get_subscription_info(\n    group_name=group_name2,\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n)\n```\n\nThe returned value is a `SubscriptionInfo` object.\n\n### List subscriptions\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `list_subscriptions()` method can be used to get information for all\nexisting persistent subscriptions, both "subscriptions to all" and\n"subscriptions to stream".\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, that\nis expected to be a Python `float`, which sets a deadline\nfor the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method also has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe example below lists all the existing persistent subscriptions.\n\n```python\nsubscriptions = client.list_subscriptions()\n```\n\nThe returned value is a list of `SubscriptionInfo` objects.\n\n\n### List subscriptions to stream\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `list_subscriptions_to_stream()` method can be used to get information for all\nthe persistent subscriptions to a stream.\n\nThis method has one required argument, `stream_name`.\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, that is expected to be a\nPython `float`, which sets a deadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method also has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\n```python\nsubscriptions = client.list_subscriptions_to_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n)\n```\n\nThe returned value is a list of `SubscriptionInfo` objects.\n\n\n### Delete subscription\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `delete_subscription()` method can be used to delete a persistent\nsubscription.\n\nThis method has a required `group_name` argument and an optional `stream_name`\nargument, which should match the values of arguments used when calling either\n`create_subscription_to_all()` or `create_subscription_to_stream()`.\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, that\nis expected to be a Python `float`, which sets a deadline\nfor the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method also has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe example below deletes the persistent subscription `group_name1` which\nwas created by calling `create_subscription_to_all()`.\n\n```python\nclient.delete_subscription(\n    group_name=group_name1,\n)\n```\n\nThe example below deleted the persistent subscription `group_name2` on\n`stream_name2` which was created by calling `create_subscription_to_stream()`.\n\n```python\nclient.delete_subscription(\n    group_name=group_name2,\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n)\n```\n\n### Call credentials\n\nDefault call credentials are derived by the client from the user info part of the\nconnection string URI.\n\nMany of the client methods described above have an optional `credentials` argument,\nwhich can be used to set call credentials for an individual method call that override\nthose derived from the connection string URI.\n\n### Construct call credentials\n\nThe client method `construct_call_credentials()` can be used to construct a call\ncredentials object from a username and password.\n\n```python\ncall_credentials = client.construct_call_credentials(\n    username=\'admin\', password=\'changeit\'\n)\n```\n\nThe call credentials object can be used as the value of the `credentials`\nargument in other client methods.\n\n## Connection\n\n### Reconnect\n\nThe `reconnect()` method can be used to manually reconnect the client to a\nsuitable EventStoreDB node. This method uses the same routine for reading the\ncluster node states and then connecting to a suitable node according to the\nclient\'s node preference that is specified in the connection string URI when\nthe client is constructed. This method is thread-safe, in that when it is called\nby several threads at the same time, only one reconnection will occur. Concurrent\nattempts to reconnect will block until the client has reconnected successfully,\nand then they will all return normally.\n\n```python\nclient.reconnect()\n```\n\nAn example of when it might be desirable to reconnect manually is when (for performance\nreasons) the client\'s node preference is to be connected to a follower node in the\ncluster, and, after a cluster leader election, the follower becomes the leader.\nReconnecting to a follower node in this case is currently beyond the capabilities of\nthis client, but this behavior might be implemented in a future release.\n\nReconnection will happen automatically in many cases, due to the `@autoreconnect`\ndecorator.\n\n### Close\n\nThe `close()` method can be used to cleanly close the client\'s gRPC connection.\n\n```python\nclient.close()\n```\n\n\n## Asyncio client\n\nThe `esdbclient` package also includes an early version of an asynchronous I/O\ngRPC Python client. It follows exactly the same behaviors as the multithreaded\n`EventStoreDBClient`, but uses the `grpc.aio` package and the `asyncio` module, instead of\n`grpc` and `threading`.\n\nThe async function `AsyncioEventStoreDBClient` constructs the client, and connects to\na server. It can be imported from `esdbclient`, and can be called with the same\narguments as `EventStoreDBClient`. It supports both the "esdb" and the "esdb+discover"\nconnection string URI schemes, and can connect to both "secure" and "insecure"\nEventStoreDB servers. It reconnects or retries when connection issues or server\nerrors are encountered.\n\n```python\nfrom esdbclient import AsyncioEventStoreDBClient\n```\n\nThe asynchronous I/O client has the following methods: `append_to_stream()`,\n`get_stream()`, `read_all()`, `subscribe_to_all()`,\n`delete_stream()`, `tombstone_stream()`, and `reconnect()`.\n\nThese methods are equivalent to the methods on `EventStoreDBClient`. They have the same\nmethod signatures, and can be called with the same arguments, to the same effect.\nThe methods which appear on `EventStoreDBClient` but not on `AsyncioEventStoreDBClient` will be\nadded soon.\n\n### Synopsis\n\nThe example below demonstrates the `append_to_stream()`, `get_stream()` and\n`subscribe_to_all()` methods. These are the most useful methods for writing\nan event-sourced application, allowing new aggregate events to be recorded, the\nrecorded events of an aggregate to be obtained so aggregates can be reconstructed,\nand the state of an application to propagated and processed with "exactly-once"\nsemantics.\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def demonstrate_asyncio_client():\n\n    # Construct client.\n    client = await AsyncioEventStoreDBClient(\n        uri=os.getenv("ESDB_URI"),\n        root_certificates=os.getenv("ESDB_ROOT_CERTIFICATES"),\n    )\n\n    # Append events.\n    stream_name = str(uuid.uuid4())\n    event1 = NewEvent("OrderCreated", data=b\'{}\')\n    event2 = NewEvent("OrderUpdated", data=b\'{}\')\n    event3 = NewEvent("OrderDeleted", data=b\'{}\')\n\n    commit_position = await client.append_to_stream(\n        stream_name=stream_name,\n        current_version=StreamState.NO_STREAM,\n        events=[event1, event2, event3]\n    )\n\n    # Read stream events.\n    recorded = await client.get_stream(stream_name)\n    assert len(recorded) == 3\n    assert recorded[0].id == event1.id\n    assert recorded[1].id == event2.id\n    assert recorded[2].id == event3.id\n\n\n    # Subscribe all events.\n    received = []\n    async for event in await client.subscribe_to_all():\n        received.append(event)\n        if event.commit_position == commit_position:\n            break\n    assert received[-3].id == event1.id\n    assert received[-2].id == event2.id\n    assert received[-1].id == event3.id\n\n\n    # Close the client.\n    await client.close()\n\n\n# Run the demo.\nasyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(\n    demonstrate_asyncio_client()\n)\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n### Regular expression filters\n\nThe `read_all()`, `subscribe_to_all()`, `create_subscription_to_all()`\nand `get_commit_position()` methods have `filter_exclude` and `filter_include`\narguments. This section provides some more details about the values of these\narguments.\n\nThe first thing to note is that these arguments are sequences of regular expressions.\nThey are concatenated together by the client as bracketed alternatives in a larger\nregular expression that is anchored to the start and end of the strings being\nmatched. So you shouldn\'t include the `\'^\'` and `\'$\'` anchor characters, unless\nthese characters are escaped as literal characters to be matched. But you should\nuse wildcards if you want to match substrings, for example `\'.*Snapshot\'` to match\nall strings that end with `\'Snapshot`\'.\n\nIn all methods, the default value of the `filter_exclude` argument is the constant\n`DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_FILTER`, which is designed to exclude EventStoreDB "system" and\n"persistence subscription config" event types, which otherwise would be included.\n\nSystem events generated by EventStoreDB have `type` strings that start with\nthe `$` sign. Persistence subscription events generated when manipulating\npersistence subscriptions have `type` strings that start with `PersistentConfig`.\n\nFor example, to match the type of EventStoreDB system events, use the regular\nexpression string `r\'\\$.+\'`. Please note, the constant `ESDB_SYSTEM_EVENTS_REGEX` is\nset to this value. You can import this constant from `esdbclient` and use it when\nbuilding longer sequences of regular expressions.\n\nSimilarly, to match the type of EventStoreDB persistence subscription events, use the\nregular expression `r\'PersistentConfig\\d+\'`. The constant `ESDB_PERSISTENT_CONFIG_EVENTS_REGEX`\nis set to this value. You can import this constant from `esdbclient`  and use it when\nbuilding longer sequences of regular expressions.\n\nThe constant `DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_FILTER` is a sequence of regular expressions that includes\nboth `ESDB_SYSTEM_EVENTS_REGEX` and `ESDB_PERSISTENT_CONFIG_EVENTS_REGEX`. It is used\nas the default value of `filter_exclude` so that the events that EventStoreDB generates\ninternally are excluded by default.\n\nFor example, if you want to exclude snapshots and system events and persistent subscription\nevents, then you may wish to use a appropriately extended copy of `DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_FILTER`\nas the value of the `filter_exclude` arguments, such as `DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_FILTER + [\'.*Snapshot\']`.\n\n\n### Reconnect and retry method decorators\n\nPlease note, nearly all the client methods are decorated with the `@autoreconnect` and\nthe `@retrygrpc` decorators.\n\nThe `@autoreconnect` decorator will reconnect to a suitable node in the cluster when\nthe server to which the client has been connected has become unavailable, or when the\nclient\'s gRPC channel happens to have been closed. The client will also reconnect when\na method is called that requires a leader, and the client\'s node preference is to be\nconnected to a leader, but the node that the client has been connected to stops being\nthe leader. In this case, the client will reconnect to the current leader. After\nreconnecting, the failed operation will be retried.\n\nThe `@retrygrpc` decorator retries operations that have failed due to a deadline being\nreached (so that the operation times out), and in case the server throws an exception\nwhen handling a client request.\n\nPlease also note, the aspects not covered by the reconnect and retry decorator\nbehaviours have to do with methods that return iterators. For example, consider\nthe "read response" iterator returned from the `read_all()` method. The\n`read_all()` method will have returned, and the method decorators will therefore\nhave exited, before iterating over the "read response" begins. Therefore, if a\nconnection issues occurs whilst iterating over the "read response", it isn\'t possible\nfor any decorator on the `read_all()` method to trigger a reconnection.\n\nWith the "catch-up subscription" objects, there is an initial "confirmation" response\nfrom the server which is received and checked by the client. And so, when a call is\nmade to `subscribe_to_all()` or `subscribe_to_stream()`, if the server is unavailable,\nor if the channel has somehow been closed, or if the request fails for some other reason,\nthen the client will reconnect and retry. However, if an exception is raised when iterating over a\nsuccessfully returned "catch-up subscription" object, the catch-up subscription will\nneed to be restarted. Similarly, when reading persistent subscriptions, if there are\nconnection issues whilst iterating over a successfully received response, the consumer\nwill need to be restarted.\n\n\n## Contributors\n\n### Install Poetry\n\nThe first thing is to check you have Poetry installed.\n\n    $ poetry --version\n\nIf you don\'t, then please [install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer).\n\n    $ curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -\n\nIt will help to make sure Poetry\'s bin directory is in your `PATH` environment variable.\n\nBut in any case, make sure you know the path to the `poetry` executable. The Poetry\ninstaller tells you where it has been installed, and how to configure your shell.\n\nPlease refer to the [Poetry docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for guidance on\nusing Poetry.\n\n### Setup for PyCharm users\n\nYou can easily obtain the project files using PyCharm (menu "Git > Clone...").\nPyCharm will then usually prompt you to open the project.\n\nOpen the project in a new window. PyCharm will then usually prompt you to create\na new virtual environment.\n\nCreate a new Poetry virtual environment for the project. If PyCharm doesn\'t already\nknow where your `poetry` executable is, then set the path to your `poetry` executable\nin the "New Poetry Environment" form input field labelled "Poetry executable". In the\n"New Poetry Environment" form, you will also have the opportunity to select which\nPython executable will be used by the virtual environment.\n\nPyCharm will then create a new Poetry virtual environment for your project, using\na particular version of Python, and also install into this virtual environment the\nproject\'s package dependencies according to the project\'s `poetry.lock` file.\n\nYou can add different Poetry environments for different Python versions, and switch\nbetween them using the "Python Interpreter" settings of PyCharm. If you want to use\na version of Python that isn\'t installed, either use your favourite package manager,\nor install Python by downloading an installer for recent versions of Python directly\nfrom the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\nOnce project dependencies have been installed, you should be able to run tests\nfrom within PyCharm (right-click on the `tests` folder and select the \'Run\' option).\n\nBecause of a conflict between pytest and PyCharm\'s debugger and the coverage tool,\nyou may need to add ``--no-cov`` as an option to the test runner template. Alternatively,\njust use the Python Standard Library\'s ``unittest`` module.\n\nYou should also be able to open a terminal window in PyCharm, and run the project\'s\nMakefile commands from the command line (see below).\n\n### Setup from command line\n\nObtain the project files, using Git or suitable alternative.\n\nIn a terminal application, change your current working directory\nto the root folder of the project files. There should be a Makefile\nin this folder.\n\nUse the Makefile to create a new Poetry virtual environment for the\nproject and install the project\'s package dependencies into it,\nusing the following command.\n\n    $ make install-packages\n\nIt\'s also possible to also install the project in \'editable mode\'.\n\n    $ make install\n\nPlease note, if you create the virtual environment in this way, and then try to\nopen the project in PyCharm and configure the project to use this virtual\nenvironment as an "Existing Poetry Environment", PyCharm sometimes has some\nissues (don\'t know why) which might be problematic. If you encounter such\nissues, you can resolve these issues by deleting the virtual environment\nand creating the Poetry virtual environment using PyCharm (see above).\n\n### Project Makefile commands\n\nYou can start EventStoreDB using the following command.\n\n    $ make start-eventstoredb\n\nYou can run tests using the following command (needs EventStoreDB to be running).\n\n    $ make test\n\nYou can stop EventStoreDB using the following command.\n\n    $ make stop-eventstoredb\n\nYou can check the formatting of the code using the following command.\n\n    $ make lint\n\nYou can reformat the code using the following command.\n\n    $ make fmt\n\nTests belong in `./tests`. Code-under-test belongs in `./esdbclient`.\n\nEdit package dependencies in `pyproject.toml`. Update installed packages (and the\n`poetry.lock` file) using the following command.\n\n    $ make update-packages\n',
+    'long_description': '# Python gRPC Client for EventStoreDB\n\nThis [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/esdbclient/) provides a Python\ngRPC client for the [EventStoreDB](https://www.eventstore.com/) database.\n\nThis client has been developed in collaboration with the EventStoreDB\nteam. Although not all the features of EventStoreDB are supported\nby this client, many of the most useful features are presented\nin an easy-to-use interface.\n\nThis client has been tested to work with EventStoreDB LTS versions 21.10\nand 22.10, without and without SSL/TLS, and with Python versions 3.7 to 3.11.\nThere is 100% test coverage. The code has typing annotations, checked with mypy.\nThe code is formatted with black and isort, and checked with flake8. Poetry\nis used for package management during development, and for building and\npublishing distributions to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/esdbclient/).\n\n## Synopsis\n\nYou can connect to an EventStoreDB database using the `EventStoreDBClient` class.\n\nThe `EventStoreDBClient` class can be imported from the `esdbclient` package.\n\nProbably the three most useful methods of `EventStoreDBClient` are:\n\n* `append_to_stream()` This method can be used to record new events in a particular\n"stream". This is useful, for example, when executing a command in an application\nthat mutates an aggregate. This method is "atomic" in that either all or none of\nthe events will be recorded.\n\n* `read_stream()` This method can be used to retrieve all the recorded\nevents in a "stream". This is useful, for example, when reconstructing\nan aggregate from recorded events before executing a command in an\napplication that creates new events.\n\n* `subscribe_to_all()` This method can be used to receive all recorded events in\nthe database. This is useful, for example, in event-processing components because\nit supports processing events with "exactly-once" semantics.\n\nThe example below uses an "insecure" EventStoreDB server running locally on port 2113.\n\n```python\nimport uuid\n\nfrom esdbclient import EventStoreDBClient, NewEvent, StreamState\n\n\n# Construct EventStoreDBClient with an EventStoreDB URI. The\n# connection string URI specifies that the client should\n# connect to an "insecure" server running on port 2113.\n\nclient = EventStoreDBClient(\n    uri="esdb://localhost:2113?Tls=false"\n)\n\n\n# Generate new events. Typically, domain events of different\n# types are generated in a domain model, and then serialized\n# into NewEvent objects. An aggregate ID may be used as the\n# name of a stream in EventStoreDB.\n\nstream_name1 = str(uuid.uuid4())\nevent1 = NewEvent(\n    type=\'OrderCreated\',\n    data=b\'{"order_number": "123456"}\'\n)\nevent2 = NewEvent(\n    type=\'OrderSubmitted\',\n    data=b\'{}\'\n)\nevent3 = NewEvent(\n    type=\'OrderCancelled\',\n    data=b\'{}\'\n)\n\n\n# Append new events to a new stream. The value returned\n# from the append_to_stream() method is the overall\n# "commit position" in the database of the last new event\n# recorded by this operation. The returned "commit position"\n# may be used in a user interface to poll an eventually\n# consistent event-processing component until it can\n# present an up-to-date materialized view. New events are\n# each allocated a "stream position", which is the next\n# available position in the stream, starting from 0.\n\ncommit_position1 = client.append_to_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name1,\n    current_version=StreamState.NO_STREAM,\n    events=[event1, event2],\n)\n\n# Append events to an existing stream. The "current version"\n# is the "stream position" of the last recorded event in a\n# stream. We have recorded two new events, so the "current\n# version" is 1. The exception \'WrongCurrentVersion\' will be\n# raised if an incorrect value is given.\n\ncommit_position2 = client.append_to_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name1,\n    current_version=1,\n    events=[event3],\n)\n\n# - allocated commit positions increase monotonically\nassert commit_position2 > commit_position1\n\n\n# Read events from a stream. This method returns a\n# "read response" iterator, which returns recorded\n# events. The iterator will stop when there are no\n# more events to be returned.\n\nread_response = client.read_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name1\n)\n\n# Iterate over "read response" to get recorded events.\n# The recorded events may be deserialized to domain event\n# objects of different types and used to reconstruct an\n# aggregate in a domain model.\nrecorded_events = tuple(read_response)\n\n# - stream \'stream_name1\' now has three events\nassert len(recorded_events) == 3\n\n# - allocated stream positions are zero-based and gapless\nassert recorded_events[0].stream_position == 0\nassert recorded_events[1].stream_position == 1\nassert recorded_events[2].stream_position == 2\n\n# - event attribute values are recorded faithfully\nassert recorded_events[0].type == "OrderCreated"\nassert recorded_events[0].data == b\'{"order_number": "123456"}\'\nassert recorded_events[0].id == event1.id\n\nassert recorded_events[1].type == "OrderSubmitted"\nassert recorded_events[1].data == b\'{}\'\nassert recorded_events[1].id == event2.id\n\nassert recorded_events[2].type == "OrderCancelled"\nassert recorded_events[2].data == b\'{}\'\nassert recorded_events[2].id == event3.id\n\n\n# Start a catch-up subscription from last recorded position.\n# This method returns a "catch-up subscription" iterator,\n# which returns recorded events. The iterator will not stop\n# when there are no more recorded events to be returned, but\n# will block, and continue when further events are recorded.\n\ncatchup_subscription = client.subscribe_to_all()\n\n\n# Iterate over the catch-up subscription. Process each recorded\n# event in turn. Within an atomic database transaction, record\n# the event\'s "commit position" along with any new state generated\n# by processing the event. Use the component\'s last recorded commit\n# position when restarting the catch-up subscription.\n\nreceived_events = []\nfor event in catchup_subscription:\n    received_events.append(event)\n\n    if event.commit_position == commit_position2:\n        # Break so we can continue with the example.\n        break\n\n\n# - events are received in the order they were recorded\nassert received_events[-3].type == "OrderCreated"\nassert received_events[-3].data == b\'{"order_number": "123456"}\'\nassert received_events[-3].id == event1.id\n\nassert received_events[-2].type == "OrderSubmitted"\nassert received_events[-2].data == b\'{}\'\nassert received_events[-2].id == event2.id\n\nassert received_events[-1].type == "OrderCancelled"\nassert received_events[-1].data == b\'{}\'\nassert received_events[-1].id == event3.id\n\n\n# Stop the catch-up subscription iterator.\n\ncatchup_subscription.stop()\n\n\n# Close the client\'s gRPC connection.\n\nclient.close()\n```\n\nSee below for more details.\n\nFor an example of usage, see the [eventsourcing-eventstoredb](\nhttps://github.com/pyeventsourcing/eventsourcing-eventstoredb) package.\n\n## Table of contents\n\n<!-- TOC -->\n* [Install package](#install-package)\n  * [From PyPI](#from-pypi)\n  * [With Poetry](#with-poetry)\n* [EventStoreDB server](#eventstoredb-server)\n  * [Run container](#run-container)\n  * [Stop container](#stop-container)\n* [EventStoreDB client](#eventstoredb-client)\n  * [Import class](#import-class)\n  * [Construct client](#construct-client)\n* [Connection strings](#connection-strings)\n  * [Two schemes](#two-schemes)\n  * [User info string](#user-info-string)\n  * [Query string](#query-string)\n  * [Examples](#examples)\n* [Event objects](#event-objects)\n  * [New events](#new-events)\n  * [Recorded events](#recorded-events)\n* [Streams](#streams)\n  * [Append events](#append-events)\n  * [Idempotent append operations](#idempotent-append-operations)\n  * [Read stream events](#read-stream-events)\n  * [Get current version](#get-current-version)\n  * [How to implement snapshotting with EventStoreDB](#how-to-implement-snapshotting-with-eventstoredb)\n  * [Read all events](#read-all-events)\n  * [Get commit position](#get-commit-position)\n  * [Get stream metadata](#get-stream-metadata)\n  * [Set stream metadata](#set-stream-metadata)\n  * [Delete stream](#delete-stream)\n  * [Tombstone stream](#tombstone-stream)\n* [Catch-up subscriptions](#catch-up-subscriptions)\n  * [Subscribe to all events](#subscribe-to-all-events)\n  * [Subscribe to stream events](#subscribe-to-stream-events)\n  * [How to implement exactly-once event processing](#how-to-implement-exactly-once-event-processing)\n* [Persistent subscriptions](#persistent-subscriptions)\n  * [Create subscription to all](#create-subscription-to-all)\n  * [Read subscription to all](#read-subscription-to-all)\n  * [How to write a persistent subscription consumer](#how-to-write-a-persistent-subscription-consumer)\n  * [Update subscription to all](#update-subscription-to-all)\n  * [Create subscription to stream](#create-subscription-to-stream)\n  * [Read subscription to stream](#read-subscription-to-stream)\n  * [Update subscription to stream](#update-subscription-to-stream)\n  * [Replay parked events](#replay-parked-events)\n  * [Get subscription info](#get-subscription-info)\n  * [List subscriptions](#list-subscriptions)\n  * [List subscriptions to stream](#list-subscriptions-to-stream)\n  * [Delete subscription](#delete-subscription)\n* [Call credentials](#call-credentials)\n  * [Construct call credentials](#construct-call-credentials)\n* [Connection](#connection)\n  * [Reconnect](#reconnect)\n  * [Close](#close)\n* [Asyncio client](#asyncio-client)\n  * [Synopsis](#synopsis-1)\n* [Notes](#notes)\n  * [Regular expression filters](#regular-expression-filters)\n  * [Reconnect and retry method decorators](#reconnect-and-retry-method-decorators)\n* [Contributors](#contributors)\n  * [Install Poetry](#install-poetry)\n  * [Setup for PyCharm users](#setup-for-pycharm-users)\n  * [Setup from command line](#setup-from-command-line)\n  * [Project Makefile commands](#project-makefile-commands)\n<!-- TOC -->\n\n## Install package\n\nIt is recommended to install Python packages into a Python virtual environment.\n\n### From PyPI\n\nYou can use pip to install this package directly from\n[the Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/esdbclient/).\n\n    $ pip install esdbclient\n\n### With Poetry\n\nYou can use Poetry to add this package to your pyproject.toml and install it.\n\n    $ poetry add esdbclient\n\n## EventStoreDB server\n\nThe EventStoreDB server can be run locally using the official Docker container image.\n\n### Run container\n\nFor development, you can run a "secure" EventStoreDB server using the following command.\n\n    $ docker run -d --name eventstoredb-secure -it -p 2113:2113 --env "HOME=/tmp" eventstore/eventstore:21.10.9-buster-slim --dev\n\nAs we will see, your client will need an EventStoreDB connection string URI as the value\nof its `uri` constructor argument. The connection string for this "secure" EventStoreDB\nserver would be:\n\n    esdb://admin:changeit@localhost:2113\n\nTo connect to a "secure" server, you will usually need to include a "username"\nand a "password" in the connection string, so that the server can authenticate the\nclient. With EventStoreDB, the default username is "admin" and the default password\nis "changeit".\n\nWhen connecting to a "secure" server, your client will also need an SSL/TLS certificate\nas the value of its `root_certificates` constructor argument. The client uses the\nSSL/TLS certificate to authenticate the server. For development, you can either use the\nSSL/TLS certificate of the certificate authority used to create the server\'s certificate,\nor when using a single-node cluster, you can use the server certificate itself. You can\nget the server certificate with the following Python code.\n\n\n```python\nimport ssl\n\nserver_certificate = ssl.get_server_certificate(addr=(\'localhost\', 2113))\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can start an "insecure" server using the following command.\n\n    $ docker run -d --name eventstoredb-insecure -it -p 2113:2113 eventstore/eventstore:21.10.9-buster-slim --insecure\n\nThe connection string URI for this "insecure" server would be:\n\n    esdb://localhost:2113?Tls=false\n\nAs we will see, when connecting to an "insecure" server, there is no need to include\na "username" and a "password" in the connection string. If you do, these values will\nbe ignored by the client, so that they are not sent over an insecure channel.\n\nPlease note, the "insecure" connection string uses a query string with the field-value\n`Tls=false`. The value of this field is by default `true`.\n\n### Stop container\n\nTo stop and remove the "secure" container, use the following Docker commands.\n\n    $ docker stop eventstoredb-secure\n\t$ docker rm eventstoredb-secure\n\nTo stop and remove the "insecure" container, use the following Docker commands.\n\n    $ docker stop eventstoredb-insecure\n\t$ docker rm eventstoredb-insecure\n\n\n## EventStoreDB client\n\nThis EventStoreDB client is implemented in the `esdbclient` package with\nthe `EventStoreDBClient` class.\n\n### Import class\n\nThe `EventStoreDBClient` class can be imported from the `esdbclient` package.\n\n```python\nfrom esdbclient import EventStoreDBClient\n```\n\n### Construct client\n\nThe `EventStoreDBClient` class has one required constructor argument, `uri`, and one\noptional constructor argument, `root_certificates`.\n\nThe `uri` argument is expected to be an EventStoreDB connection string URI that\nconforms with the standard EventStoreDB "esdb" or "esdb+discover" URI schemes.\n\nFor example, the following connection string specifies that the client should\nattempt to create a "secure" connection to port 2113 on "localhost", and use the\nclient credentials "username" and "password" when making calls to the server.\n\n    esdb://username:password@localhost:2113?Tls=true\n\nThe client must be configured to create a "secure" connection to a "secure" server,\nor alternatively an "insecure" connection to an "insecure" server. By default, the\nclient will attempt to create a "secure" connection. And so, when connecting to an\n"insecure" server, the connection string must specify that the client should attempt\nto make an "insecure" connection.\n\nThe following connection string specifies that the client should\nattempt to create an "insecure" connection to port 2113 on "localhost".\nWhen connecting to an "insecure" server, the client will ignore any\nusername and password information included in the connection string,\nso that usernames and passwords are not sent over an "insecure" connection.\n\n    esdb://localhost:2113?Tls=false\n\nPlease note, the "insecure" connection string uses a query string with the field-value\n`Tls=false`. The value of this field is by default `true`. Unless the connection string\nURI includes the field-value `Tls=false` in the query string, the `root_certificates`\nconstructor argument is also required.\n\nWhen connecting to a "secure" server, the `root_certificates` argument is expected to\nbe a Python `str` containing PEM encoded SSL/TLS root certificates. This value is\npassed directly to `grpc.ssl_channel_credentials()`. It is used for authenticating the\nserver to the client. It is commonly the certificate of the certificate authority that\nwas responsible for generating the SSL/TLS certificate used by the EventStoreDB server.\nBut, alternatively for development, you can use the server\'s certificate itself.\n\nIn the example below, the constructor argument values are taken from the operating\nsystem environment. This is a typical arrangement in a production environment. It is\ndone this way here so that the code in this documentation can be tested with both\na "secure" and an "insecure" server.\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nclient = EventStoreDBClient(\n    uri=os.getenv("ESDB_URI"),\n    root_certificates=os.getenv("ESDB_ROOT_CERTIFICATES"),\n)\n```\n\n## Connection strings\n\nAn EventStoreDB connection string is a URI that conforms with one of two possible\nschemes: either the "esdb" scheme, or the "esdb+discover" scheme.\n\nThe syntax and semantics of the EventStoreDB URI schemes are described below. The\nsyntax is defined using [EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus–Naur_form).\n\n### Two schemes\n\nThe "esdb" URI scheme can be defined in the following way.\n\n    esdb-uri = "esdb://" , [ user-info , "@" ] , grpc-target, { "," , grpc-target } , [ "?" , query-string ] ;\n\nIn the "esdb" URI scheme, after the optional user info string, there must be at least\none gRPC target. If there are several gRPC targets, they must be separated from each\nother with the "," character. Each gRPC target should indicate an EventStoreDB gRPC\nserver socket, by specifying a host and a port number separated with the ":" character.\nThe host may be a hostname that can be resolved to an IP address, or an IP address.\n\n    grpc-target = ( hostname | ip-address ) , ":" , port-number ;\n\n\nThe "esdb+discover" URI scheme can be defined in the following way.\n\n    esdb-discover-uri = "esdb+discover://" , [ user-info, "@" ] , cluster-domainname , [ "?" , query-string ] ;\n\nIn the "esdb+discover" URI scheme, after the optional user info string, there must be a\ndomain name which should identify a cluster of EventStoreDB servers. The client will use\na DNS server to resolve the domain name to a list of addresses of EventStoreDB servers,\nby querying for \'A\' records. In this case, the port number "2113" will be used to\nconstruct gRPC targets from the addresses obtained from \'A\' records provided by the\nDNS server. Therefore, if you want to use the "esdb+discover" URI scheme, you will\nneed to configure DNS when setting up your EventStoreDB cluster.\n\nWith both the "esdb" and "esdb+discover" URI schemes, the client firstly obtains\na list of gRPC targets: either directly from "esdb" connection strings; or indirectly\nfrom "esdb+discover" connection strings via DNS. This list of targets is known as the\n"gossip seed". The client will then attempt to connect to each gRPC target in turn,\nattempting to call the EventStoreDB Gossip API to obtain information about the\nEventStoreDB cluster. A member of the cluster is selected by the client, according\nto the "node preference" option. The client may then need to close its\nconnection and reconnect to the selected server.\n\n### User info string\n\nIn both the "esdb" and "esdb+discover" schemes, the URI may include a user info string.\nIf it exists in the URI, the user info string must be separated from the rest of the URI\nwith the "@" character. The user info string must include a username and a password,\nseparated with the ":" character.\n\n    user-info = username , ":" , password ;\n\nThe user info is sent by the client as "call credentials" in each call to a "secure"\nserver, in a "basic auth" authorization header. This authorization header is used by\nthe server to authenticate the client. The authorization header is not sent to\n"insecure" servers.\n\n### Query string\n\nIn both the "esdb" and "esdb+discover" schemes, the optional query string must be one\nor many field-value arguments, separated from each other with the "&" character.\n\n    query-string = field-value, { "&", field-value } ;\n\nEach field-value argument must be one of the supported fields, and an\nappropriate value, separated with the "=" character.\n\n    field-value = ( "Tls", "=" , "true" | "false" )\n                | ( "TlsVerifyCert", "=" , "true" | "false" )\n                | ( "ConnectionName", "=" , string )\n                | ( "NodePreference", "=" , "leader" | "follower" | "readonlyreplica" | "random" )\n                | ( "DefaultDeadline", "=" , integer )\n                | ( "GossipTimeout", "=" , integer )\n                | ( "MaxDiscoverAttempts", "=" , integer )\n                | ( "DiscoveryInterval", "=" , integer )\n                | ( "MaxDiscoverAttempts", "=" , integer )\n                | ( "KeepAliveInterval", "=" , integer )\n                | ( "KeepAliveInterval", "=" , integer ) ;\n\nThe table below describes the query field-values supported by this client.\n\n| Field               | Value                                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                       |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Tls                 | "true", "false" (default: "true")                                     | If "true" the client will create a "secure" gRPC channel.

And\nthen to connect to a "leader" node. And also to use "admin" and\n"changeit" as the username and password when making calls to\nEventStoreDB API methods.\n\n    esdb://admin:changeit@localhost:2113\n\n\nThe following URI will cause the client to get cluster info from\n"insecure" server socket 127.0.0.1:2113.  And then to connect to\na "leader" node.\n\n    esdb://127.0.0.1:2113?Tls=false\n\n\nThe following URI will cause the client to get cluster info from\naddresses in DNS \'A\' records for cluster1.example.com. And then\nto connect to a "leader" node. And use a default deadline of 5\nseconds when making calls to EventStore API "write" methods.\n\n    esdb+discover://admin:changeit@cluster1.example.com?DefaultDeadline=5\n\n\nThe following URI will cause the client to get cluster info from either\nlocalhost:2111, or localhost:2112, or localhost:2113. And then to connect\nto a "follower" node.\n\n    esdb://admin:changeit@localhost:2111,localhost:2112,localhost:2113?NodePreference=follower\n\n\nThe following URI will cause the client to get cluster info from addresses in\nDNS \'A\' records for cluster1.example.com. And to configure "keep alive" timeout\nand interval in the gRPC channel.\n\n    esdb+discover://admin:changeit@cluster1.example.com?KeepAliveInterval=10000&KeepAliveTimeout=10000\n\n\nPlease note, the client is insensitive to the case of fields and values. If fields are\nrepeated in the query string, the query string will be parsed without error. However,\nthe connection options used by the client will use the value of the first field. All\nthe other field-values in the query string with the same field name will be ignored.\nFields without values will also be ignored.\n\nIf the client\'s node preference is "leader" and the node becomes a\n"follower", the client will attempt to reconnect to the current leader when a method\nis called that expects to call a leader. Methods which mutate the state of the database\nexpect to call a leader. For such methods, the HTTP header "requires-leader" is set to\n"true", and this header is observed by the server, and so a node which is not a leader\nthat receives such a request will return an error. This error is detected by the client,\nwhich will then close the current gRPC connection and create a new connection to the\nleader. The request will then be retried with the leader.\n\nIf the client\'s node preference is "follower" and there are no follower\nnodes in the cluster, then the client will raise an exception. Similarly, if the\nclient\'s node preference is "readonlyreplica" and there are no read-only replica\nnodes in the cluster, then the client will also raise an exception.\n\nThe gRPC channel option "grpc.max_receive_message_length" is automatically\nconfigured to the value `17 * 1024 * 1024`. This value cannot be changed.\n\n\n## Event objects\n\nThis package defines a `NewEvent` class and a `RecordedEvent` class. The\n`NewEvent` class should be used when writing events to the database. The\n`RecordedEvent` class is used when reading events from the database.\n\n### New events\n\nThe `NewEvent` class should be used when writing events to an EventStoreDB database.\nYou will need to construct new event objects before calling `append_to_stream()`.\n\nThe `NewEvent` class is a frozen Python dataclass. It has two required constructor\narguments (`type` and `data`) and three optional constructor arguments (`metadata`,\n`content_type` and `id`).\n\nThe required `type` argument is a Python `str`, used to describe the type of\ndomain event that is being recorded.\n\nThe required `data` argument is a Python `bytes` object, used to state the\nserialized data of the domain event that is being recorded.\n\nThe optional `metadata` argument is a Python `bytes` object, used to indicate any\nmetadata of the event that will be recorded. The default value is an empty `bytes`\nobject.\n\nThe optional `content_type` argument is a Python `str`, used to indicate the\nkind of data that is being recorded. The default value is `\'application/json\'`,\nwhich indicates that the `data` was serialised using JSON. An alternative value\nfor this argument is the more general indication `\'application/octet-stream\'`.\n\nThe optional `id` argument is a Python `UUID` object, used to specify the unique ID\nof the event that will be recorded. If no value is provided, a new version-4 UUID\nwill be generated.\n\n```python\nnew_event1 = NewEvent(\n    type=\'OrderCreated\',\n    data=b\'{"name": "Greg"}\',\n)\nassert new_event1.type == \'OrderCreated\'\nassert new_event1.data == b\'{"name": "Greg"}\'\nassert new_event1.metadata == b\'\'\nassert new_event1.content_type == \'application/json\'\nassert isinstance(new_event1.id, uuid.UUID)\n\nevent_id = uuid.uuid4()\nnew_event2 = NewEvent(\n    type=\'ImageCreated\',\n    data=b\'01010101010101\',\n    metadata=b\'{"a": 1}\',\n    content_type=\'application/octet-stream\',\n    id=event_id,\n)\nassert new_event2.type == \'ImageCreated\'\nassert new_event2.data == b\'01010101010101\'\nassert new_event2.metadata == b\'{"a": 1}\'\nassert new_event2.content_type == \'application/octet-stream\'\nassert new_event2.id == event_id\n```\n\n### Recorded events\n\nThe `RecordedEvent` class is used when reading events from an EventStoreDB\ndatabase. The client will return event objects of this type from all methods\nthat return recorded events, such as `get_stream()`, `subscribe_to_all()`,\nand `read_subscription_to_all()`. You do not need to construct recorded event objects.\n\nLike `NewEvent`, the `RecordedEvent` class is also a frozen Python dataclass. It has\nall the attributes that `NewEvent` has (`type`, `data`, `metadata`, `content_type`, `id`)\nand some additional attributes that follow from the fact that an event was recorded\n(`stream_name`, `stream_position`, `commit_position`).\n\nThe `type` attribute is a Python `str`, used to indicate the type of an event\nthat was recorded.\n\nThe `data` attribute is a Python `bytes` object, used to indicate the data of an\nevent that was recorded.\n\nThe `metadata` attribute is a Python `bytes` object, used to indicate the metadata of\nan event that was recorded.\n\nThe `content_type` attribute is a Python `str`, used to indicate the type of\ndata that was recorded for an event. It is usually `\'application/json\'`, indicating\nthat the data can be parsed as JSON. Alternatively, it is `\'application/octet-stream\'`.\n\nThe `id` attribute is a Python `UUID` object, used to indicate the unique ID of an\nevent that was recorded.\n\nThe `stream_name` attribute is a Python `str`, used to indicate the name of a\nstream in which an event was recorded.\n\nThe `stream_position` attribute is a Python `int`, used to indicate the position in a\nstream at which an event was recorded.\n\nIn EventStoreDB, a "stream position" is an integer representing the position of a\nrecorded event in a stream. Each recorded event is recorded at a position in a stream.\nEach stream position is occupied by only one recorded event. New events are recorded at the\nnext unoccupied position. All sequences of stream positions are zero-based and gapless.\n\nThe `commit_position` attribute is a Python `int`, used to indicate the position in the\ndatabase at which an event was recorded.\n\nIn EventStoreDB, a "commit position" is an integer representing the position of a\nrecorded event in the database. Each recorded event is recorded at a position in the\ndatabase. Each commit position is occupied by only one recorded event. Commit positions\nare zero-based and increase monotonically as new events are recorded. But, unlike stream\npositions, the sequence of successive commit positions is not gapless. Indeed, there are\nusually large differences between the commit positions of successively recorded events.\n\nPlease note, in EventStoreDB 21.10, the `commit_position` of all `RecordedEvent` objects\nobtained from `read_stream()` is `None`, whereas those obtained from `read_all()` have\nthe actual commit position of the recorded event. This was changed in version 22.10, so\nthat event objects obtained from both `get_stream()` and `read_all()` have the actual\ncommit position. The `commit_position` attribute of the `RecordedEvent` class is\nannotated with the type `Optional[int]` for this reason only.\n\n\n```python\nfrom esdbclient.events import RecordedEvent\n\nrecorded_event = RecordedEvent(\n    type=\'OrderCreated\',\n    data=b\'{}\',\n    metadata=b\'\',\n    content_type=\'application/json\',\n    id=uuid.uuid4(),\n    stream_name=\'stream1\',\n    stream_position=0,\n    commit_position=512,\n)\n```\n\n\n## Streams\n\nIn EventStoreDB, a "stream" is a sequence of recorded events that all have\nthe same "stream name". There will normally be many streams in a database,\neach with many recorded events. Each recorded event has a position in its stream\n(the "stream position"), and a position in the database (the "commit position").\nStream positions are zero-based and gapless. Commit positions are also zero-based,\nbut are not gapless.\n\nThe methods `append_to_stream()`, `get_stream()` and `read_all()` can\nbe used to read and record in the database.\n\n### Append events\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `append_to_stream()` method can be used atomically to record a sequence of new events.\nIf the operation is successful, it returns the commit position of the last event in the\nsequence that has been recorded.\n\nThis method has three required arguments, `stream_name`, `current_version`\nand `events`.\n\nThe required `stream_name` argument is a Python `str` that uniquely identifies a\nstream to which a sequence of events will be appended.\n\nThe required `current_version` argument is expected to be either a Python `int`\nthat indicates the stream position of the last recorded event in the stream, or\n`StreamState.NO_STREAM` if the stream does not yet exist or has been deleted. The\nstream positions are zero-based and gapless, so that if a stream has two events, the\n`current_version` should be 1. If an incorrect value is given, this method will raise a\n`WrongCurrentVersion` exception. This behavior is designed to provide concurrency\ncontrol when recording new events. The correct value of `current_version` for any stream\ncan be obtained by calling `get_current_version()`. However, the typical approach is to\nreconstruct an aggregate from the recorded events, so that the version of the aggregate\nis the stream position of the last recorded event, then have the aggregate generate new\nevents, and then use the current version of the aggregate as the value of the\n`current_version` argument when appending the new aggregate events. This ensures\nthe consistency of the recorded aggregate events, because operations that generate\nnew aggregate events can be retried with a freshly reconstructed aggregate if\na `WrongCurrentVersion` exception is encountered when recording new events. This\ncontrolling behavior can be disabled by setting the value of the `current_version`\nargument to the constant `StreamState.ANY`.\n\nThe required `events` argument is expected to be a sequence of new event objects. The\n`NewEvent` class should be used to construct new event objects. The `append_to_stream()`\noperation is atomic, so that either all or none of the new events will be recorded. It\nis not possible with EventStoreDB atomically to record new events in more than one stream.\n\nThis method also has an optional `timeout` argument, which is a Python `float`\nthat sets a deadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method also has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nIn the example below, a new event, `event1`, is appended to a new stream. The stream\ndoes not yet exist, so `current_version` is `StreamState.NO_STREAM`.\n\n```python\n# Construct a new event object.\nevent1 = NewEvent(type=\'OrderCreated\', data=b\'data1\')\n\n# Define a new stream name.\nstream_name1 = str(uuid.uuid4())\n\n# Append the new events to the new stream.\ncommit_position1 = client.append_to_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name1,\n    current_version=StreamState.NO_STREAM,\n    events=[event1],\n)\n```\n\nIn the example below, two subsequent events are appended to an existing\nstream. The stream has one recorded event, so `current_version` is `0`.\n\n```python\nevent2 = NewEvent(type=\'OrderUpdated\', data=b\'data2\')\nevent3 = NewEvent(type=\'OrderDeleted\', data=b\'data3\')\n\ncommit_position2 = client.append_to_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name1,\n    current_version=0,\n    events=[event2, event3],\n)\n```\n\nThe returned values, `commit_position1` and `commit_position2`, are the\ncommit positions in the database of the last events in the recorded sequences.\nThat is, `commit_position1` is the commit position of `event1` and\n`commit_position2` is the commit position of `event3`.\n\nCommit positions that are returned in this way can be used by a user interface to poll\na downstream component until it has processed all the newly recorded events. For example,\nconsider a user interface command that results in the recording of new events, and an\neventually consistent materialized view in a downstream component that is updated from\nthese events. If the new events have not yet been processed, the view might be stale,\nor out-of-date. Instead of displaying a stale view, the user interface can poll the\ndownstream component until it has processed the newly recorded events, and then display\nan up-to-date view to the user.\n\n\n### Idempotent append operations\n\nThe `append_to_stream()` method is "idempotent", in that if called with new events whose\n`id` attribute values equal those of recorded events in the named stream immediately\nafter the stream position specified by the value of the `current_version` argument, then\nit will return the commit position of the last new event, without making any changes to\nthe database.\n\nSometimes it may happen, when calling `append_to_stream()`, that the new events are\nsuccessfully recorded but somehow a connection issue occurs before the successful call\ncan return successfully to the client. We cannot be sure if the events were recorded\nor not, and so we may wish to retry. If the events were in fact successfully recorded,\nit is convenient for the retried operation to return successfully without raising an\nexception. If those new events were in fact not recorded, and in the meantime no other\nnew events were recorded in that stream, then it makes sense that the new events will\nbe recorded when the append operation is retried. Of course, if a `WrongCurrentVersion`\nexception is raised when retrying the operation, then an application command which\ngenerated the new events in the context of already recorded events may need to be\nexecuted again. Alternatively, a suitable error might be displayed by the application,\nwith an up-to-date view of the recorded data, giving a user of the application an\nopportunity to decide if they still wish to proceed with their original intention.\n\nThe example below shows the `append_to_stream()` method being called again with\n`event3` and `current_version=0`. We can see that repeating the call to\n`append_to_stream()` returns successfully.\n\n```python\n# Retry appending event3.\ncommit_position_retry = client.append_to_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name1,\n    current_version=0,\n    events=[event2, event3],\n)\n```\n\nWe can see that the same commit position is returned as above.\n\n```python\nassert commit_position_retry == commit_position2\n```\n\nBy calling `get_stream()`, we can also see the stream has been unchanged\ndespite the `append_to_stream()` method having been called twice with the same arguments.\nThat is, there are still only three events in the stream.\n\n```python\nevents = client.get_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name1\n)\n\nassert len(events) == 3\n```\n\nThis idempotent behaviour depends on the `id` attribute of the `NewEvent` class.\nThis attribute, by default, is assigned a new and unique version-4 UUID when an\ninstance of `NewEvent` is constructed. The `id` argument can be used when\nconstructing `NewEvent` objects to set the value of this attribute.\n\n\n### Read stream events\n\nThe `read_stream()` method can be used to get events that have been appended\nto a stream. This method returns a "read response" object.\n\nA "read response" object is a Python iterator. Recorded events can be\nobtained by iterating over the "read response" object. Recorded events are\nstreamed from the server to the client as the iteration proceeds. The iteration\nwill automatically stop when there are no more recorded events to be returned.\nThe streaming of events, and hence the iterator, can also be stopped by calling\nthe `stop()` method on the "read response" object.\n\nThe `get_stream()` method can be used to get events that have been appended\nto a stream. This method returns a Python `tuple` of recorded event objects.\nThe recorded event objects are instances of the `RecordedEvent` class. It\ncalls `read_stream()` and passes the "read response" iterator into a Python\n`tuple`, so that the streaming will complete before the method returns.\n\nThe `read_stream()` and `get_stream()` methods have one required argument, `stream_name`.\n\nThe required `stream_name` argument is a Python `str` that uniquely identifies a\nstream from which recorded events will be returned.\n\nThe `read_stream()` and `get_stream()` methods also have five optional arguments,\n`stream_position`, `backwards`, `resolve_links`, `limit`, and `timeout`.\n\nThe optional `stream_position` argument is a Python `int` that can be used to\nindicate the position in the stream from which to start reading. The default value\nof `stream_position` is `None`. When reading a stream from a specific position in the\nstream, the recorded event at that position will be included, both when reading\nforwards from that position, and when reading backwards.\n\nThe optional `backwards` argument is a Python `bool`. The default value of `backwards`\nis `False`, which means the stream will be read forwards, so that events are returned\nin the order they were recorded. If `backwards` is `True`, the events are returned in\nreverse order.\n\nIf `backwards` is `False` and `stream_position` is `None`, the stream\'s events will be\nreturned in the order they were recorded, starting from the first recorded event. If\n`backwards` is `True` and `stream_position` is `None`, the stream\'s events will be\nreturned in reverse order, starting from the last recorded event.\n\nThe optional `resolve_links` argument is a Python `bool`. The default value of `resolve_links`\nis `False`, which means any event links will not be resolved, so that the events that are\nreturned may represent event links. If `resolve_links` is `True`, any event links will\nbe resolved, so that the linked events will be returned instead of the event links.\n\nThe optional `limit` argument is a Python `int` which restricts the number of events\nthat will be returned. The default value of `limit` is `sys.maxint`.\n\nThe optional `timeout` argument is a Python `float` which sets a deadline for\nthe completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method also has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe example below shows the default behavior, which is to return all the recorded\nevents of a stream forwards from the first recorded events to the last.\n\n```python\nevents = client.get_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name1\n)\n\nassert len(events) == 3\nassert events[0].id == event1.id\nassert events[1].id == event2.id\nassert events[2].id == event3.id\n```\n\nThe example below shows how to use the `stream_position` argument to read a stream\nfrom a specific stream position to the end of the stream. Stream positions are\nzero-based, and so `stream_position=1` corresponds to the second event that was\nrecorded in the stream, in this case `event2`.\n\n```python\nevents = client.get_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name1,\n    stream_position=1,\n)\n\nassert len(events) == 2\nassert events[0].id == event2.id\nassert events[1].id == event3.id\n```\n\nThe example below shows how to use the `backwards` argument to read a stream backwards.\n\n```python\nevents = client.get_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name1,\n    backwards=True,\n)\n\nassert len(events) == 3\nassert events[0].id == event3.id\nassert events[1].id == event2.id\nassert events[2].id == event1.id\n```\n\nThe example below shows how to use the `limit` argument to read a limited number of\nevents.\n\n```python\nevents = client.get_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name1,\n    limit=2,\n)\n\nassert len(events) == 2\nassert events[0].id == event1.id\nassert events[1].id == event2.id\n```\n\nThe `read_stream()` and `get_stream()` methods will raise a `NotFound` exception if the\nnamed stream has never existed or has been deleted.\n\n```python\nfrom esdbclient.exceptions import NotFound\n\n\ntry:\n    client.get_stream(\'does-not-exist\')\nexcept NotFound:\n    pass  # The stream does not exist.\nelse:\n    raise Exception("Shouldn\'t get here")\n```\n\nPlease note, the `get_stream()` method is decorated with the `@autoreconnect` and\n`@retrygrpc` decorators, whilst the `read_stream()` method is not. This means that\nall errors due to connection issues will be caught by the retry and reconnect decorators\nwhen calling the `get_stream()` method, but not when calling `read_stream()`. The\n`read_stream()` method has no such decorators because the streaming only starts\nwhen iterating over the "read response" starts, which means that the method returns\nbefore the streaming starts, and so there is no chance for any decorators to catch\nany connection issues.\n\nFor the same reason, `read_stream()` will not raise a `NotFound` exception when\nthe stream does not exist, until iterating over the "read response" object begins.\n\nIf you are reading a very large stream, then you might prefer to call `read_stream()`,\nand begin iterating through the recorded events whilst they are being streamed from\nthe server, rather than both waiting and having them all accumulate in memory.\n\n### Get current version\n\nThe `get_current_version()` method is a convenience method that essentially calls\n`get_stream()` with `backwards=True` and `limit=1`. This method returns\nthe value of the `stream_position` attribute of the last recorded event in a\nstream. If a stream does not exist, the returned value is `StreamState.NO_STREAM`.\nThe returned value is the correct value of `current_version` when appending events\nto a stream, and when deleting or tombstoning a stream.\n\nThis method has one required argument, `stream_name`.\n\nThe required `stream_name` argument is a Python `str` that uniquely identifies a\nstream from which a stream position will be returned.\n\nThis method also has an optional `timeout` argument, that\nis expected to be a Python `float`, which sets a deadline\nfor the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method also has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nIn the example below, the last stream position of `stream_name1` is obtained.\nSince three events have been appended to `stream_name1`, and because positions\nin a stream are zero-based and gapless, so the current version is `2`.\n\n```python\ncurrent_version = client.get_current_version(\n    stream_name=stream_name1\n)\n\nassert current_version == 2\n```\n\nIf a stream has never existed or has been deleted, the returned value is\n`StreamState.NO_STREAM`, which is the correct value of the `current_version`\nargument both when appending the first event of a new stream, and also when\nappending events to a stream that has been deleted.\n\n```python\ncurrent_version = client.get_current_version(\n    stream_name=\'does-not-exist\'\n)\n\nassert current_version is StreamState.NO_STREAM\n```\n\n### How to implement snapshotting with EventStoreDB\n\nSnapshots can improve the performance of aggregates that would otherwise be\nreconstructed from very long streams. However, it is generally recommended to design\naggregates to have a finite lifecycle, and so to have relatively short streams,\nthereby avoiding the need for snapshotting. This "how to" section is intended merely\nto show how snapshotting of aggregates can be implemented with EventStoreDB using\nthis Python client.\n\nEvent-sourced aggregates are typically reconstructed from recorded events by calling\na mutator function for each recorded event, evolving from an initial state\n`None` to the current state of the aggregate. The function `get_aggregate()` shows\nhow this can be done. The aggregate ID is used as a stream name. The exception\n`AggregateNotFound` is raised if the aggregate stream is not found.\n\n```python\nclass AggregateNotFound(Exception):\n    """Raised when an aggregate is not found."""\n\n\ndef get_aggregate(aggregate_id, mutator_func):\n    stream_name = aggregate_id\n\n    # Get recorded events.\n    try:\n        events = client.get_stream(\n            stream_name=stream_name,\n            stream_position=None\n        )\n    except NotFound as e:\n        raise AggregateNotFound(aggregate_id) from e\n    else:\n        # Reconstruct aggregate from recorded events.\n        aggregate = None\n        for event in events:\n            aggregate = mutator_func(aggregate, event)\n        return aggregate\n```\n\nSnapshotting of aggregates can be implemented by recording the current state of\nan aggregate as a new event.\n\nIf an aggregate object has a version number that corresponds to the stream position of\nthe last event that was used to reconstruct the aggregate, and this version number\nis recorded in the snapshot metadata, then any events that are recorded after the\nsnapshot can be selected using this version number. The aggregate can then be\nreconstructed from the last snapshot and any subsequent events, without having\nto replay the entire history.\n\nWe will use a separate stream for an aggregate\'s snapshots that is named after the\nstream used for recording its events. The name of the snapshot stream will be\nconstructed by prefixing the aggregate\'s stream name with `\'snapshot-$\'`.\n\n```python\nSNAPSHOT_STREAM_NAME_PREFIX = \'snapshot-$\'\n\ndef make_snapshot_stream_name(stream_name):\n    return f\'{SNAPSHOT_STREAM_NAME_PREFIX}{stream_name}\'\n\n\ndef remove_snapshot_stream_prefix(snapshot_stream_name):\n    assert snapshot_stream_name.startswith(SNAPSHOT_STREAM_NAME_PREFIX)\n    return snapshot_stream_name[len(SNAPSHOT_STREAM_NAME_PREFIX):]\n```\n\nNow, let\'s redefine the `get_aggregate()` function, so that it looks for a snapshot event,\nthen selects subsequent aggregate events, and then calls a mutator function for each\nrecorded event.\n\nNotice that the aggregate events are read from a stream for serialized aggregate\nevents, whilst the snapshot is read from a separate stream for serialized aggregate\nsnapshots. We will use JSON to serialize and deserialize event data.\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n\ndef get_aggregate(aggregate_id, mutator_func):\n    stream_name = aggregate_id\n    recorded_events = []\n\n    # Look for a snapshot.\n    try:\n        snapshots = client.get_stream(\n            stream_name=make_snapshot_stream_name(stream_name),\n            backwards=True,\n            limit=1\n        )\n    except NotFound:\n        stream_position = None\n    else:\n        assert len(snapshots) == 1\n        snapshot = snapshots[0]\n        stream_position = deserialize(snapshot.metadata)[\'version\'] + 1\n        recorded_events.append(snapshot)\n\n    # Get subsequent events.\n    try:\n        events = client.get_stream(\n            stream_name=stream_name,\n            stream_position=stream_position\n        )\n    except NotFound as e:\n        raise AggregateNotFound(aggregate_id) from e\n    else:\n        recorded_events += events\n\n    # Reconstruct aggregate from recorded events.\n    aggregate = None\n    for event in recorded_events:\n        aggregate = mutator_func(aggregate, event)\n\n    return aggregate\n\n\ndef serialize(d):\n    return json.dumps(d).encode(\'utf8\')\n\n\ndef deserialize(s):\n    return json.loads(s.decode(\'utf8\'))\n```\n\nTo show how `get_aggregate()` can be used, let\'s define a `Dog` aggregate class, with\nattributes `name` and `tricks`. The attributes `id` and `version` will indicate an\naggregate object\'s ID and version number. The attribute `is_from_snapshot` is added\nhere merely to demonstrate below when an aggregate object has been reconstructed using\na snapshot.\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\nclass Aggregate:\n    id: str\n    version: int\n    is_from_snapshot: bool\n\n\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\nclass Dog(Aggregate):\n    name: str\n    tricks: list\n```\n\nLet\'s also define a mutator function `mutate_dog()` that evolves the state of a\n`Dog` aggregate given various different types of events, `\'DogRegistered\'`,\n`\'DogLearnedTrick\'`, and `\'Snapshot\'`.\n\n```python\ndef mutate_dog(dog, event):\n    data = deserialize(event.data)\n    if event.type == \'DogRegistered\':\n        return Dog(\n            id=event.stream_name,\n            version=event.stream_position,\n            is_from_snapshot=False,\n            name=data[\'name\'],\n            tricks=[],\n        )\n    elif event.type == \'DogLearnedTrick\':\n        assert event.stream_position == dog.version + 1\n        assert event.stream_name == dog.id, (event.stream_name, dog.id)\n        return Dog(\n            id=dog.id,\n            version=event.stream_position,\n            is_from_snapshot=dog.is_from_snapshot,\n            name=dog.name,\n            tricks=dog.tricks + [data[\'trick\']],\n        )\n    elif event.type == \'Snapshot\':\n        return Dog(\n            id=remove_snapshot_stream_prefix(event.stream_name),\n            version=deserialize(event.metadata)[\'version\'],\n            is_from_snapshot=True,\n            name=data[\'name\'],\n            tricks=data[\'tricks\'],\n        )\n    else:\n        raise Exception(f"Unknown event type: {event.type}")\n```\n\nFor convenience, let\'s also define a `get_dog()` function that calls `get_aggregate()`\nwith the `mutate_dog()` function as the value of its `mutator_func` argument.\n\n```python\ndef get_dog(dog_id):\n    return get_aggregate(\n        aggregate_id=dog_id,\n        mutator_func=mutate_dog,\n    )\n```\n\nWe can also define some "command" functions that append new events to the\ndatabase. The `register_dog()` function appends a `DogRegistered` event. The\n`record_trick_learned()` appends a `DogLearnedTrick` event. The function\n`snapshot_dog()` appends a `Snapshot` event. Notice that the\n`record_trick_learned()` and `snapshot_dog()` functions use `get_dog()`.\n\nNotice also that the `DogRegistered` and `DogLearnedTrick` events are appended to a\nstream for aggregate events, whilst the `Snapshot` event is appended to a separate\nstream for aggregate snapshots.\n\n```python\ndef register_dog(name):\n    dog_id = str(uuid.uuid4())\n    event = NewEvent(\n        type=\'DogRegistered\',\n        data=serialize({\'name\': name}),\n    )\n    client.append_to_stream(\n        stream_name=dog_id,\n        current_version=StreamState.NO_STREAM,\n        events=event,\n    )\n    return dog_id\n\n\ndef record_trick_learned(dog_id, trick):\n    dog = get_dog(dog_id)\n    event = NewEvent(\n        type=\'DogLearnedTrick\',\n        data=serialize({\'trick\': trick}),\n    )\n    client.append_to_stream(\n        stream_name=dog_id,\n        current_version=dog.version,\n        events=event,\n    )\n\n\ndef snapshot_dog(dog_id):\n    dog = get_dog(dog_id)\n    event = NewEvent(\n        type=\'Snapshot\',\n        data=serialize({\'name\': dog.name, \'tricks\': dog.tricks}),\n        metadata=serialize({\'version\': dog.version}),\n    )\n    client.append_to_stream(\n        stream_name=make_snapshot_stream_name(dog_id),\n        current_version=StreamState.ANY,\n        events=event,\n    )\n```\n\nWe can call `register_dog()` to register a new dog.\n\n```python\n# Register a new dog.\ndog_id = register_dog(\'Fido\')\n\ndog = get_dog(dog_id)\nassert dog.name == \'Fido\'\nassert dog.tricks == []\nassert dog.version == 0\nassert dog.is_from_snapshot is False\n\n```\n\nWe can call `record_trick_learned()` to record that some tricks have been learned.\n\n```python\n\n# Record that \'Fido\' learned a new trick.\nrecord_trick_learned(dog_id, trick=\'roll over\')\n\ndog = get_dog(dog_id)\nassert dog.name == \'Fido\'\nassert dog.tricks == [\'roll over\']\nassert dog.version == 1\nassert dog.is_from_snapshot is False\n\n\n# Record that \'Fido\' learned another new trick.\nrecord_trick_learned(dog_id, trick=\'fetch ball\')\n\ndog = get_dog(dog_id)\nassert dog.name == \'Fido\'\nassert dog.tricks == [\'roll over\', \'fetch ball\']\nassert dog.version == 2\nassert dog.is_from_snapshot is False\n```\n\nWe can call `snapshot_dog()` to record a snapshot of the current state of the `Dog`\naggregate. After we call `snapshot_dog()`, the `get_dog()` function will return a `Dog`\nobject that has been constructed using the `Snapshot` event.\n\n```python\n# Snapshot \'Fido\'.\nsnapshot_dog(dog_id)\n\ndog = get_dog(dog_id)\nassert dog.name == \'Fido\'\nassert dog.tricks == [\'roll over\', \'fetch ball\']\nassert dog.version == 2\nassert dog.is_from_snapshot is True\n```\n\nWe can continue to evolve the state of the `Dog` aggregate, using\nthe snapshot both during the call to `record_trick_learned()` and\nwhen calling `get_dog()` directly.\n\n```python\nrecord_trick_learned(dog_id, trick=\'sit\')\n\ndog = get_dog(dog_id)\nassert dog.name == \'Fido\'\nassert dog.tricks == [\'roll over\', \'fetch ball\', \'sit\']\nassert dog.version == 3\nassert dog.is_from_snapshot is True\n```\n\nWe can see from the `is_from_snapshot` attribute that the `Dog` object was indeed\nreconstructed from the snapshot.\n\nSnapshots can be created at fixed version number intervals, fixed time\nperiods, after a particular type of event, immediately after events are\nappended, or as a background process.\n\n\n### Read all events\n\nThe `read_all()` method can be used to get all recorded events\nin the database in the order they were recorded. This method returns\na "read response" object, just like `read_stream()`.\n\nA "read response" is an iterator, and not a sequence. Recorded events can be\nobtained by iterating over the "read response" object. Recorded events are\nstreamed from the server to the client as the iteration proceeds. The iteration\nwill automatically stop when there are no more recorded events to be returned.\nThe streaming of events, and hence the iterator, can also be stopped by calling\nthe `stop()` method on the "read response" object. The recorded event objects\nare instances of the `RecordedEvent` class.\n\nThis method has eight optional arguments, `commit_position`, `backwards`,\n`filter_exclude`, `filter_include`, `filter_by_stream_name`, `limit`, `timeout`,\nand `credentials`.\n\nThe optional `commit_position` argument is a Python `int` that can be used to\nspecify a commit position from which to start reading. The default value of\n`commit_position` is `None`. Please note, if a commit position is specified,\nit must be an actually existing commit position in the database. When reading\nforwards, the event at the commit position may be included, depending upon the\nfilter. When reading backwards, the event at the commit position will not be\nincluded.\n\nThe optional `backwards` argument is a Python `bool`. The default of `backwards` is\n`False`, which means events are returned in the order they were recorded, If\n`backwards` is `True`, then events are returned in reverse order.\n\nIf `backwards` is `False` and `commit_position` is `None`, the database\'s events will\nbe returned in the order they were recorded, starting from the first recorded event.\nThis is the default behavior of `read_all()`. If `backwards` is `True` and\n`commit_position` is `None`, the database\'s events will be returned in reverse order,\nstarting from the last recorded event.\n\nThe optional `filter_exclude` argument is a sequence of regular expressions that\nspecifies which recorded events should be returned. This argument is ignored\nif `filter_include` is set to a non-empty sequence. The default value of this\nargument matches the event types of EventStoreDB "system events", so that system\nevents will not normally be included. See the Notes section below for more\ninformation about filter expressions.\n\nThe optional `filter_include` argument is a sequence of regular expressions\nthat specifies which recorded events should be returned. By default, this\nargument is an empty tuple. If this argument is set to a non-empty sequence,\nthe `filter_exclude` argument is ignored.\n\nThe optional `filter_by_stream_name` argument is a Python `bool` that indicates\nwhether the filtering will apply to event types or stream names. By default, this\nvalue is `False` and so the filtering will apply to the event type strings of\nrecorded events.\n\nThe optional `limit` argument is an integer which restricts the number of events that\nwill be returned. The default value is `sys.maxint`.\n\nThe optional `timeout` argument is a Python `float` which sets a\ndeadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThe optional `credentials` argument can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe filtering of events is done on the EventStoreDB server. The\n`limit` argument is applied on the server after filtering.\n\nThe example below shows how to get all the events we have recorded in the database\nso far, in the order they were recorded. We can see the three events of `stream_name1`\n(`event1`, `event2` and `event3`) are included, along with others.\n\n```python\n# Read all events (creates a streaming gRPC call).\nread_response = client.read_all()\n\n# Convert the iterator into a sequence of recorded events.\nevents = tuple(read_response)\nassert len(events) > 3  # more than three\n\n# Convert the sequence of recorded events into a set of event IDs.\nevent_ids = set(e.id for e in events)\nassert event1.id in event_ids\nassert event2.id in event_ids\nassert event3.id in event_ids\n```\n\nThe example below shows how to read all recorded events in the database from\na particular commit position, in this case `commit_position1`. When reading\nforwards from a specific commit position, the event at the specified position\nwill be included. The value of `commit_position1` is the position we obtained\nwhen appending `event1`. And so `event1` is the first recorded event we shall\nreceive, `event2` is the second, and `event3` is the third.\n\n```python\n# Read all events forwards from a commit position.\nread_response = client.read_all(\n    commit_position=commit_position1\n)\n\n# Step through the "read response" iterator.\nassert next(read_response).id == event1.id\nassert next(read_response).id == event2.id\nassert next(read_response).id == event3.id\n\n# Stop the iterator.\nread_response.stop()\n```\n\nThe example below shows how to read all events recorded in the database in reverse\norder. We can see that the first events we receive are the last events that were\nrecorded: the events of the `Dog` aggregate from the section about snapshotting\nand the snapshot.\n\n```python\n# Read all events backwards from the end.\nread_response = client.read_all(\n    backwards=True\n)\n\n# Step through the "read response" iterator.\nassert next(read_response).type == "DogLearnedTrick"\nassert next(read_response).type == "Snapshot"\nassert next(read_response).type == "DogLearnedTrick"\nassert next(read_response).type == "DogLearnedTrick"\nassert next(read_response).type == "DogRegistered"\n\n# Stop the iterator.\nread_response.stop()\n```\n\nThe example below shows how to read a limited number of events\nforwards from a specific commit position.\n\n```python\nevents = tuple(\n    client.read_all(\n        commit_position=commit_position1,\n        limit=1,\n    )\n)\n\nassert len(events) == 1\nassert events[0].id == event1.id\n```\n\nThe example below shows how to read a limited number of the recorded events\nin the database backwards from the end. In this case, the limit is 1, and\nso we receive the last recorded event.\n\n```python\nevents = tuple(\n    client.read_all(\n        backwards=True,\n        limit=1,\n    )\n)\n\nassert len(events) == 1\n\nassert events[0].type == \'DogLearnedTrick\'\nassert deserialize(events[0].data)[\'trick\'] == \'sit\'\n```\n\nPlease note, like the `read_stream()` method, the `read_all()` method\nis not decorated with retry and reconnect decorators, because the streaming of recorded\nevents from the server only starts when iterating over the "read response" starts, which\nmeans that the method returns before the streaming starts, and so there is no chance for\nany decorators to catch any connection issues.\n\n### Get commit position\n\nThe `get_commit_position()` method can be used to get the commit position of the\nlast recorded event in the database. It simply calls `read_all()` with\n`backwards=True` and `limit=1`, and returns the value of the `commit_position`\nattribute of the last recorded event.\n\n```python\ncommit_position = client.get_commit_position()\n```\n\nThis method has five optional arguments, `filter_exclude`, `filter_include`,\n`filter_by_stream_name`, `timeout` and `credentials`. These values are passed to\n`read_all()`.\n\nThe optional `filter_exclude`, `filter_include` and `filter_by_stream_name` arguments\nwork in the same way as they do in the `read_all()` method.\n\nThe optional `timeout` argument is a Python `float` that sets\na deadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThe optional `credentials` argument can be used to override call credentials\nderived from the connection string URI.\n\nThis method might be used to measure progress of a downstream component\nthat is processing all recorded events, by comparing the current commit\nposition with the recorded commit position of the last successfully processed\nevent in a downstream component. In this case, the value of the `filter_exclude`,\n`filter_include` and `filter_by_stream_name` arguments should equal those used\nby the downstream component to obtain recorded events.\n\n\n### Get stream metadata\n\nThe `get_stream_metadata()` method returns the metadata for a stream, along\nwith the version of the stream metadata.\n\nThis method has one required argument, `stream_name`, which is a Python `str` that\nuniquely identifies a stream for which a stream metadata will be obtained.\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, which is a Python `float` that sets\na deadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nIn the example below, metadata for `stream_name1` is obtained.\n\n```python\nmetadata, metadata_version = client.get_stream_metadata(stream_name=stream_name1)\n```\n\nThe returned `metadata` value is a Python `dict`. The returned `metadata_version`\nvalue is either an `int` if the stream exists, or `StreamState.NO_STREAM` if the stream\ndoes not exist and no metadata has been set. These values can be used as the arguments\nof `set_stream_metadata()`.\n\n### Set stream metadata\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe method `set_stream_metadata()` sets metadata for a stream. Stream metadata\ncan be set before appending events to a stream.\n\nThis method has one required argument, `stream_name`, which is a Python `str` that\nuniquely identifies a stream for which a stream metadata will be set.\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, which is a Python `float` that sets\na deadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nIn the example below, metadata for `stream_name1` is set.\n\n\n```python\nmetadata["foo"] = "bar"\n\nclient.set_stream_metadata(\n    stream_name=stream_name1,\n    metadata=metadata,\n    current_version=metadata_version,\n)\n```\n\nThe `current_version` argument should be the current version of the stream metadata\nobtained from `get_stream_metadata()`.\n\nPlease refer to the EventStoreDB documentation for more information about stream\nmetadata.\n\n### Delete stream\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe method `delete_stream()` can be used to "delete" a stream.\n\nThis method has two required arguments, `stream_name` and `current_version`.\n\nThe required `stream_name` argument is a Python `str` that uniquely identifies a\nstream to which a sequence of events will be appended.\n\nThe required `current_version` argument is expected to be either a Python `int`\nthat indicates the stream position of the last recorded event in the stream.\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, which is a Python `float` that sets\na deadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nIn the example below, `stream_name1` is deleted.\n\n```python\ncommit_position = client.delete_stream(stream_name=stream_name1, current_version=2)\n```\n\nAfter deleting a stream, it\'s still possible to append new events. Reading from a\ndeleted stream will return only events that have been appended after it was\ndeleted.\n\n### Tombstone stream\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe method `tombstone_stream()` can be used to "tombstone" a stream.\n\nThis method has two required arguments, `stream_name` and `current_version`.\n\nThe required `stream_name` argument is a Python `str` that uniquely identifies a\nstream to which a sequence of events will be appended.\n\nThe required `current_version` argument is expected to be either a Python `int`\nthat indicates the stream position of the last recorded event in the stream.\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, which is a Python `float` that sets\na deadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nIn the example below, `stream_name1` is tombstoned.\n\n```python\ncommit_position = client.tombstone_stream(stream_name=stream_name1, current_version=2)\n```\n\nAfter tombstoning a stream, it\'s not possible to append new events.\n\n\n## Catch-up subscriptions\n\nA "catch-up" subscription can be used to receive events that have already been\nrecorded and events that are recorded subsequently. A catch-up subscription can\nbe used by an event-processing component that processes recorded events with\n"exactly-once" semantics.\n\nThe `subscribe_to_all()` method starts a catch-up subscription that can receive\nall events in the database. The `subscribe_to_stream()` method starts a catch-up\nsubscription that can receive events from a specific stream. Both methods return a\n"catch-up subscription" object, which is a Python iterator. Recorded events can be\nobtained by iteration. Recorded event objects obtained in this way are instances\nof the `RecordedEvent` class.\n\nBefore the "catch-up subscription" object is returned to the caller, the client will\nfirstly obtain a "confirmation" response from the server, which allows the client to\ndetect that both the gRPC connection and the streaming gRPC call is operational. For\nthis reason, the `subscribe_to_all()` and `subscribe_to_stream()` methods are both\nusefully decorated with the reconnect and retry decorators. However, once the method\nhas returned, the decorators will have exited, and any exceptions that are raised\ndue to connection issues whilst iterating over the subscription object will have to\nbe handled by your code.\n\nA "catch-up subscription" iterator will not automatically stop when there are no more\nevents to be returned, but instead the iteration will block until new events are\nsubsequently recorded in the database. Any subsequently recorded events will then be\nimmediately streamed to the client, and the iteration will then continue. The streaming\nof events, and hence the iteration, can be stopped by calling the `stop()` method on the\n"catch-up subscription" object.\n\n### Subscribe to all events\n\nThe`subscribe_to_all()` method can be used to start a catch-up subscription\nfrom which all events recorded in the database can be obtained in the order\nthey were recorded. This method returns a "catch-up subscription" iterator.\n\nThis method also has six optional arguments, `commit_position`, `filter_exclude`,\n`filter_include`, `filter_by_stream_name`, `timeout` and `credentials`.\n\nThe optional `commit_position` argument specifies a commit position. The default\nvalue of `commit_position` is `None`, which means the catch-up subscription will\nstart from the first recorded event in the database. If a commit position is given,\nit must match an actually existing commit position in the database. Only events\nrecorded after that position will be obtained.\n\nThe optional `filter_exclude` argument is a sequence of regular expressions that\nspecifies which recorded events should be returned. This argument is ignored\nif `filter_include` is set to a non-empty sequence. The default value of this\nargument matches the event types of EventStoreDB "system events", so that system\nevents will not normally be included. See the Notes section below for more\ninformation about filter expressions.\n\nThe optional `filter_include` argument is a sequence of regular expressions\nthat specifies which recorded events should be returned. By default, this\nargument is an empty tuple. If this argument is set to a non-empty sequence,\nthe `filter_exclude` argument is ignored.\n\nThe optional `filter_by_stream_name` argument is a Python `bool` that indicates\nwhether the filtering will apply to event types or stream names. By default, this\nvalue is `False` and so the filtering will apply to the event type strings of\nrecorded events.\n\nThe optional `timeout` argument is a Python `float` which sets a\ndeadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThe optional `credentials` argument can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe example below shows how to start a catch-up subscription that starts\nfrom the first recorded event in the database.\n\n```python\n# Subscribe from the first recorded event in the database.\ncatchup_subscription = client.subscribe_to_all()\n```\n\nThe example below shows that catch-up subscriptions do not stop\nautomatically, but block when the last recorded event is received,\nand then continue when subsequent events are recorded.\n\n```python\nfrom time import sleep\nfrom threading import Thread\n\n\n# Append a new event to a new stream.\nstream_name2 = str(uuid.uuid4())\nevent4 = NewEvent(type=\'OrderCreated\', data=b\'data4\')\n\nclient.append_to_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n    current_version=StreamState.NO_STREAM,\n    events=[event4],\n)\n\n\n# Receive events from the catch-up subscription in a different thread.\nreceived_events = []\n\ndef receive_events():\n    for event in catchup_subscription:\n        received_events.append(event)\n\n\ndef wait_for_event(event_id):\n    for _ in range(100):\n        for event in reversed(received_events):\n            if event.id == event_id:\n                return\n        else:\n            sleep(0.1)\n    else:\n        raise AssertionError("Event wasn\'t received")\n\n\nthread = Thread(target=receive_events, daemon=True)\nthread.start()\n\n# Wait to receive event4.\nwait_for_event(event4.id)\n\n# Append another event whilst the subscription is running.\nevent5 = NewEvent(type=\'OrderUpdated\', data=b\'data5\')\nclient.append_to_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n    current_version=0,\n    events=[event5],\n)\n\n# Wait for the subscription to block.\nwait_for_event(event5.id)\n\n# Stop the subscription.\ncatchup_subscription.stop()\nthread.join()\n```\n\nThe example below shows how to subscribe to events recorded after a\nparticular commit position, in this case from the commit position of\nthe last recorded event that was received above. Another event is\nrecorded before the subscription is restarted. Further events are\nrecorded whilst the subscription is running. The events we appended\nare received in the order they were recorded.\n\n\n```python\n\n# Append another event.\nevent6 = NewEvent(type=\'OrderDeleted\', data=b\'data6\')\nclient.append_to_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n    current_version=1,\n    events=[event6],\n)\n\n# Restart subscribing to all events after the\n# commit position of the last received event.\ncatchup_subscription = client.subscribe_to_all(\n    commit_position=received_events[-1].commit_position\n)\n\nthread = Thread(target=receive_events, daemon=True)\nthread.start()\n\n# Wait for event6.\nwait_for_event(event6.id)\n\n# Append three more events to a new stream.\nstream_name3 = str(uuid.uuid4())\nevent7 = NewEvent(type=\'OrderCreated\', data=b\'data7\')\nevent8 = NewEvent(type=\'OrderUpdated\', data=b\'data8\')\nevent9 = NewEvent(type=\'OrderDeleted\', data=b\'data9\')\n\nclient.append_to_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name3,\n    current_version=StreamState.NO_STREAM,\n    events=[event7, event8, event9],\n)\n\n# Wait for events.\nwait_for_event(event7.id)\nwait_for_event(event8.id)\nwait_for_event(event9.id)\n\n# Stop the subscription.\ncatchup_subscription.stop()\nthread.join()\n```\n\nThe catch-up subscription call is ended as soon as the subscription object\'s\n`stop()` method is called. This happens automatically when it goes out of scope,\nor when it is explicitly deleted from memory using the Python `del` keyword.\n\n### Subscribe to stream events\n\nThe `subscribe_to_stream()` method can be used to start a catch-up subscription\nfrom which events recorded in a single stream can be obtained. This method\nreturns a "catch-up subscription" iterator.\n\nThis method has a required `stream_name` argument, which specifies the name of the\nstream from which recorded events will be received.\n\nThis method also has four optional arguments, `stream_position`, `resolve_links`,\n`timeout` and `credentials`.\n\nThe optional `stream_position` argument specifies a position in the stream. The\ndefault value of `stream_position` is `None`, which means that all events\nrecorded in the stream will be obtained in the order they were recorded.\nIf a stream position is given, then only events recorded after that position\nwill be obtained.\n\nThe optional `resolve_links` argument is a Python `bool`. The default value of `resolve_links`\nis `False`, which means any event links will not be resolved, so that the events that are\nreturned may represent event links. If `resolve_links` is `True`, any event links will\nbe resolved, so that the linked events will be returned instead of the event links.\n\nThe optional `timeout` argument is a Python `float` that sets\na deadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThe optional `credentials` argument can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe example below shows how to start a catch-up subscription from\nthe first recorded event in a stream.\n\n```python\n# Subscribe from the start of \'stream2\'.\nsubscription = client.subscribe_to_stream(stream_name=stream_name2)\n```\n\nThe example below shows how to start a catch-up subscription from\na particular stream position.\n\n```python\n# Subscribe to stream2, from the second recorded event.\nsubscription = client.subscribe_to_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n    stream_position=1,\n)\n```\n\n### How to implement exactly-once event processing\n\nThe commit positions of recorded events that are received and processed by a\ndownstream component are usefully recorded by the downstream component, so that\nthe commit position of last processed event can be determined when processing is\nresumed.\n\nThe last recorded commit position can be used to specify the commit position from which\nto subscribe when processing is resumed. Since this commit position will represent the\nposition of the last successfully processed event in a downstream component, so it\nwill be usual to want the next event after this position, because that is the next\nevent that has not yet been processed. For this reason, when subscribing for events\nfrom a specific commit position using a catch-up subscription in EventStoreDB, the\nrecorded event at the specified commit position will NOT be included in the sequence\nof recorded events that are received.\n\nTo accomplish "exactly-once" processing of recorded events in a downstream\ncomponent when using a catch-up subscription, the commit position of a recorded\nevent should be recorded atomically and uniquely along with the result of processing\nrecorded events, for example in the same database as materialised views when\nimplementing eventually-consistent CQRS, or in the same database as a downstream\nanalytics or reporting or archiving application. By recording the commit position\nof recorded events atomically with the new state that results from processing\nrecorded events, "dual writing" in the consumption of recorded events can be\navoided. By also recording the commit position uniquely, the new state cannot be\nrecorded twice, and hence the recorded state of the downstream component will be\nupdated only once for any recorded event. By using the greatest recorded commit\nposition to resume a catch-up subscription, all recorded events will eventually\nbe processed. The combination of the "at-most-once" condition and the "at-least-once"\ncondition gives the "exactly-once" condition.\n\nThe danger with "dual writing" in the consumption of recorded events is that if a\nrecorded event is successfully processed and new state recorded atomically in one\ntransaction with the commit position recorded in a separate transaction, one may\nhappen and not the other. If the new state is recorded but the position is lost,\nand then the processing is stopped and resumed, the recorded event may be processed\ntwice. On the other hand, if the commit position is recorded but the new state is\nlost, the recorded event may effectively not be processed at all. By either\nprocessing an event more than once, or by failing to process an event, the recorded\nstate of the downstream component might be inaccurate, or possibly inconsistent, and\nperhaps catastrophically so. Such consequences may or may not matter in your situation.\nBut sometimes inconsistencies may halt processing until the issue is resolved. You can\navoid "dual writing" in the consumption of events by atomically recording the commit\nposition of a recorded event along with the new state that results from processing that\nevent in the same atomic transaction. By making the recording of the commit positions\nunique, so that transactions will be rolled back when there is a conflict, you will\nprevent the results of any duplicate processing of a recorded event being committed.\n\nRecorded events received from a catch-up subscription cannot be acknowledged back\nto the EventStoreDB server. Acknowledging events, however, is an aspect of "persistent\nsubscriptions". Hoping to rely on acknowledging events to an upstream\ncomponent is an example of dual writing.\n\n\n## Persistent subscriptions\n\nIn EventStoreDB, "persistent" subscriptions are similar to catch-up subscriptions,\nin that reading a persistent subscription will block when there are no more recorded\nevents to be received, and then continue when new events are subsequently recorded.\n\nPersistent subscriptions can\n\nPersistent subscriptions can be consumed by a group of consumers operating with one\nof the supported "consumer strategies".\n\nThe significant different with persistent subscriptions is the server will keep track\nof the progress of the consumers. The consumer of a persistent subscription will\ntherefore need to "acknowledge" when a recorded event has been processed successfully,\nand otherwise "negatively acknowledge" a recorded event that has been received but was\nnot successfully processed.\n\nAll of this means that for persistent subscriptions there are "create", "read", "update"\n"delete", "ack", and "nack" operations to consider.\n\nWhilst there are some advantages of persistent subscriptions, in particular the\nconcurrent processing of recorded events by a group of consumers, by tracking in\nthe server the position in the commit sequence of events that have been processed,\nthe issue of "dual writing" in the consumption of events arises. Reliability in the\nprocessing of recorded events by a group of persistent subscription consumers will\nrely on their idempotent handling of duplicate messages, and their resilience to\nout-of-order delivery.\n\n\n### Create subscription to all\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `create_subscription_to_all()` method can be used to create a "persistent subscription"\nto all the recorded events in the database across all streams.\n\nThis method has a required `group_name` argument, which is the\nname of a "group" of consumers of the subscription.\n\nThis method also has eight optional arguments, `from_end`, `commit_position`,\n`filter_exclude`, `filter_include`, `filter_by_stream_name`, `consumer_strategy`,\n`timeout` and `credentials`.\n\nThe optional `from_end` argument can be used to specify that the group of consumers\nof the subscription should only receive events that were recorded after the subscription\nwas created.\n\nAlternatively, the optional `commit_position` argument can be used to specify a commit\nposition from which commit position the group of consumers of the subscription should\nreceive events. Please note, the recorded event at the specified commit position might\nbe included in the recorded events received by the group of consumers.\n\nIf neither `from_end` or `commit_position` are specified, the group of consumers\nof the subscription will potentially receive all recorded events in the database.\n\nThe optional `filter_exclude` argument is a sequence of regular expressions that\nspecifies which recorded events should be returned. This argument is ignored\nif `filter_include` is set to a non-empty sequence. The default value of this\nargument matches the event types of EventStoreDB "system events", so that system\nevents will not normally be included. See the Notes section below for more\ninformation about filter expressions.\n\nThe optional `filter_include` argument is a sequence of regular expressions\nthat specifies which recorded events should be returned. By default, this\nargument is an empty tuple. If this argument is set to a non-empty sequence,\nthe `filter_exclude` argument is ignored.\n\nThe optional `filter_by_stream_name` argument is a Python `bool` that indicates\nwhether the filtering will apply to event types or stream names. By default, this\nvalue is `False` and so the filtering will apply to the event type strings of\nrecorded events.\n\nThe optional `consumer_strategy` argument is a Python `str` that defines\nthe consumer strategy for this persistent subscription. The value of this argument\ncan be `\'DispatchToSingle\'`, `\'RoundRobin\'`, `\'Pinned\'`, or `\'PinnedByCorrelation\'`. The\ndefault value is `\'DispatchToSingle\'`.\n\nThe optional `timeout` argument is a Python `float` which sets a\ndeadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThe optional `credentials` argument can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe method `create_subscription_to_all()` does not return a value. Recorded events are\nobtained by calling the `read_subscription_to_all()` method.\n\nIn the example below, a persistent subscription is created to operate from the\nfirst recorded non-system event in the database.\n\n```python\n# Create a persistent subscription.\ngroup_name1 = f"group-{uuid.uuid4()}"\nclient.create_subscription_to_all(group_name=group_name1)\n```\n\n### Read subscription to all\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `read_subscription_to_all()` method can be used by a group of consumers to receive\nrecorded events from a persistent subscription that has been created using\nthe `create_subscription_to_all()` method.\n\nThis method has a required `group_name` argument, which is\nthe name of a "group" of consumers of the subscription specified\nwhen `create_subscription_to_all()` was called.\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, that\nis expected to be a Python `float`, which sets a deadline\nfor the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method also has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThis method returns a `PersistentSubscription` object, which is an iterator\ngiving `RecordedEvent` objects. It also has `ack()`, `nack()` and `stop()`\nmethods.\n\n```python\nsubscription = client.read_subscription_to_all(group_name=group_name1)\n```\n\nThe `ack()` method should be used by a consumer to indicate to the server that it\nhas received and successfully processed a recorded event. This will prevent that\nrecorded event being received by another consumer in the same group. The `ack()`\nmethod takes an `event_id` argument, which is the ID of the recorded event that\nhas been received.\n\nThe example below iterates over the subscription object, and calls `ack()`. The\n`stop()` method is called when we have received the last event, so that we can\ncontinue with the examples below.\n\n```python\nreceived_events = []\n\nfor event in subscription:\n    received_events.append(event)\n\n    # Acknowledge the received event.\n    subscription.ack(event_id=event.id)\n\n    # Stop when \'event9\' has been received.\n    if event.id == event9.id:\n        subscription.stop()\n```\n\nThe events are not guaranteed to be received in the order they were recorded. But\nwe will have received `event9`.\n\n```python\nassert event9.id in [e.id for e in received_events]\n```\n\nThe `PersistentSubscription` object also has an `nack()` method that should be used\nby a consumer to negatively acknowledge to the server that it has received but not\nsuccessfully processed a recorded event. The `nack()` method has an `event_id`\nargument, which is the ID of the recorded event that has been received. The `nack()`\nmethod also has an `action` argument, which should be a Python `str`: either\n`\'unknown\'`, `\'park\'`, `\'retry\'`, `\'skip\'` or `\'stop\'`.\n\n\n### How to write a persistent subscription consumer\n\nThe reading of a persistent subscription can be encapsulated in a "consumer" that calls\na "policy" function when a recorded event is received and then automatically calls\n`ack()` if the policy function returns normally, and `nack()` if it raises an exception,\nperhaps retrying the event for a certain number of times before parking the event.\n\nThe simple example below shows how this might be done. We can see that \'event9\' is\nacknowledged before \'event5\' is finally parked.\n\n\n```python\nacked_events = {}\nnacked_events = {}\n\n\nclass ExampleConsumer:\n    def __init__(self, subscription, max_retries, final_action):\n        self.subscription = subscription\n        self.max_retries = max_retries\n        self.final_action = final_action\n        self.error = None\n\n    def run(self):\n        try:\n            for event in self.subscription:\n                try:\n                    self.policy(event)\n                except Exception:\n                    if event.retry_count < self.max_retries:\n                        action = "retry"\n                    else:\n                        action = self.final_action\n                    self.subscription.nack(event.id, action=action)\n                    self.after_nack(event, action)\n                else:\n                    self.subscription.ack(event.id)\n                    self.after_ack(event)\n        except Exception:\n            self.stop()\n            raise\n\n    def stop(self):\n        self.subscription.stop()\n\n    def policy(self, event):\n        # Raise an exception when we see "event5".\n        if event.id == event5.id:\n            raise Exception()\n\n    def after_ack(self, event):\n        # Track retry count of acked events.\n        acked_events[event.id] = event.retry_count\n\n    def after_nack(self, event, action):\n        # Track retry count of nacked events.\n        nacked_events[event.id] = event.retry_count\n\n        if action == self.final_action:\n            # Stop the consumer, so we can continue with the examples.\n            self.stop()\n\n\n# Create subscription.\ngroup_name = f"group-{uuid.uuid4()}"\nclient.create_subscription_to_all(group_name, commit_position=commit_position1)\n\n# Read subscription.\nsubscription = client.read_subscription_to_all(group_name)\n\n# Construct consumer.\nconsumer = ExampleConsumer(\n    subscription=subscription,\n    max_retries=5,\n    final_action="park",\n)\n\n# Run consumer.\nconsumer.run()\n\n# Check \'event5\' was nacked and never acked.\nassert event5.id in nacked_events\nassert event5.id not in acked_events\nassert nacked_events[event5.id] == 5\n\n# Check \'event9\' was acked and never nacked.\nassert event9.id in acked_events\nassert event9.id not in nacked_events\n```\n\n### Update subscription to all\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `update_subscription_to_all()` method can be used to update a\n"persistent subscription".\n\nThis method has a required `group_name` argument, which is the\nname of a "group" of consumers of the subscription.\n\nThis method also has three optional arguments, `from_end`, `commit_position`, `timeout`\nand `credentials`.\n\nThe optional `from_end` argument can be used to specify that the group of consumers\nof the subscription should only receive events that were recorded after the subscription\nwas updated.\n\nAlternatively, the optional `commit_position` argument can be used to specify a commit\nposition from which commit position the group of consumers of the subscription should\nreceive events. Please note, the recorded event at the specified commit position might\nbe included in the recorded events received by the group of consumers.\n\nIf neither `from_end` or `commit_position` are specified, the group of consumers\nof the subscription will potentially receive all recorded events in the database.\n\nPlease note, the filter options and consumer strategy cannot be adjusted.\n\nThe optional `timeout` argument is a Python `float` which sets a\ndeadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThe optional `credentials` argument can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe method `update_subscription_to_all()` does not return a value.\n\nIn the example below, a persistent subscription is updated to run from the end of the\ndatabase.\n\n```python\n# Create a persistent subscription.\nclient.update_subscription_to_all(group_name=group_name1, from_end=True)\n```\n\n### Create subscription to stream\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `create_subscription_to_stream()` method can be used to create a persistent\nsubscription to a stream.\n\nThis method has two required arguments, `group_name` and `stream_name`. The\n`group_name` argument names the group of consumers that will receive events\nfrom this subscription. The `stream_name` argument specifies which stream\nthe subscription will follow. The values of both these arguments are expected\nto be Python `str` objects.\n\nThis method also has five optional arguments, `stream_position`, `from_end`,\n`consumer_strategy`, `timeout` and `credentials`.\n\nThe optional `stream_position` argument specifies a stream position from\nwhich to subscribe. The recorded event at this stream\nposition will be received when reading the subscription.\n\nThe optional `from_end` argument is a Python `bool`.\nBy default, the value of this argument is `False`. If this argument is set\nto `True`, reading from the subscription will receive only events\nrecorded after the subscription was created. That is, it is not inclusive\nof the current stream position.\n\nThe optional `consumer_strategy` argument is a Python `str` that defines\nthe consumer strategy for this persistent subscription. The value of this argument\ncan be `\'DispatchToSingle\'`, `\'RoundRobin\'`, `\'Pinned\'`, or `\'PinnedByCorrelation\'`. The\ndefault value is `\'DispatchToSingle\'`.\n\nThe optional `timeout` argument is a Python `float` which sets a deadline\nfor the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThe optional `credentials` argument can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThis method does not return a value. Events can be received by calling\n`read_subscription_to_stream()`.\n\nThe example below creates a persistent stream subscription from the start of the stream.\n\n```python\n# Create a persistent stream subscription from start of the stream.\ngroup_name2 = f"group-{uuid.uuid4()}"\nclient.create_subscription_to_stream(\n    group_name=group_name2,\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n)\n```\n\n### Read subscription to stream\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `read_subscription_to_stream()` method can be used to read a persistent\nsubscription to a stream.\n\nThis method has two required arguments, `group_name` and `stream_name`, which\nshould match the values of arguments used when calling `create_subscription_to_stream()`.\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, that\nis expected to be a Python `float`, which sets a deadline\nfor the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method also has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThis method returns a `PersistentSubscription` object, which is an iterator\ngiving `RecordedEvent` objects, that also has `ack()`, `nack()` and `stop()`\nmethods.\n\n```python\nsubscription = client.read_subscription_to_stream(\n    group_name=group_name2,\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n)\n```\n\nThe example below iterates over the subscription object, and calls `ack()`.\nThe for loop breaks when we have received the last event in the stream, so\nthat we can finish the examples in this documentation.\n\n```python\nevents = []\nfor event in subscription:\n    events.append(event)\n\n    # Acknowledge the received event.\n    subscription.ack(event_id=event.id)\n\n    # Stop when \'event6\' has been received.\n    if event.id == event6.id:\n        subscription.stop()\n```\n\nWe can check we received all the events that were appended to `stream_name2`\nin the examples above.\n\n```python\nassert len(events) == 3\nassert events[0].stream_name == stream_name2\nassert events[0].id == event4.id\nassert events[1].stream_name == stream_name2\nassert events[1].id == event5.id\nassert events[2].stream_name == stream_name2\nassert events[2].id == event6.id\n```\n\n### Update subscription to stream\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `update_subscription_to_stream()` method can be used to update a\npersistent subscription to a stream.\n\nThis method has a required `group_name` argument, which is the\nname of a "group" of consumers of the subscription, and a required\n`stream_name` argument, which is the name of a stream.\n\nThis method also has four optional arguments, `from_end`, `stream_position`,\n`timeout` and `credentials`.\n\nThe optional `from_end` argument can be used to specify that the group of consumers\nof the subscription should only receive events that were recorded after the subscription\nwas updated.\n\nAlternatively, the optional `stream_position` argument can be used to specify a stream\nposition from which commit position the group of consumers of the subscription should\nreceive events. Please note, the recorded event at the specified stream position might\nbe included in the recorded events received by the group of consumers.\n\nIf neither `from_end` or `commit_position` are specified, the group of consumers\nof the subscription will potentially receive all recorded events in the stream.\n\nPlease note, the consumer strategy cannot be adjusted.\n\nThe optional `timeout` argument is a Python `float` which sets a\ndeadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThe optional `credentials` argument can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe `update_subscription_to_stream()` method does not return a value.\n\nIn the example below, a persistent subscription to a stream is updated to run from the\nend of the stream.\n\n```python\n# Create a persistent subscription.\nclient.update_subscription_to_stream(\n    group_name=group_name2,\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n    from_end=True,\n)\n```\n\n### Replay parked events\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `replay_parked_events()` method can be used to "replay" events that have\nbeen "parked" (negatively acknowledged with the action `\'park\'`) when reading\na persistent subscription. Parked events will then be received again by consumers\nreading from the persistent subscription.\n\nThis method has a required `group_name` argument and an optional `stream_name`\nargument. The values of these arguments should match those used when calling\n`create_subscription_to_all()` or `create_subscription_to_stream()`.\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, that\nis expected to be a Python `float`, which sets a deadline\nfor the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method also has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe example below replays parked events for group `group_name1`.\n\n```python\nclient.replay_parked_events(\n    group_name=group_name1,\n)\n```\n\nThe example below replays parked events for group `group_name2`.\n\n```python\nclient.replay_parked_events(\n    group_name=group_name2,\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n)\n```\n\n### Get subscription info\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `get_subscription_info()` method can be used to get information for a\npersistent subscription.\n\nThis method has a required `group_name` argument and an optional `stream_name`\nargument, which should match the values of arguments used when calling either\n`create_subscription_to_all()` or `create_subscription_to_stream()`.\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, that\nis expected to be a Python `float`, which sets a deadline\nfor the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method also has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe example below gets information for the persistent subscription `group_name1` which\nwas created by calling `create_subscription_to_all()`.\n\n```python\nsubscription_info = client.get_subscription_info(\n    group_name=group_name1,\n)\n```\n\nThe example below gets information for the persistent subscription `group_name2` on\n`stream_name2` which was created by calling `create_subscription_to_stream()`.\n\n```python\nsubscription_info = client.get_subscription_info(\n    group_name=group_name2,\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n)\n```\n\nThe returned value is a `SubscriptionInfo` object.\n\n### List subscriptions\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `list_subscriptions()` method can be used to get information for all\nexisting persistent subscriptions, both "subscriptions to all" and\n"subscriptions to stream".\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, that\nis expected to be a Python `float`, which sets a deadline\nfor the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method also has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe example below lists all the existing persistent subscriptions.\n\n```python\nsubscriptions = client.list_subscriptions()\n```\n\nThe returned value is a list of `SubscriptionInfo` objects.\n\n\n### List subscriptions to stream\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `list_subscriptions_to_stream()` method can be used to get information for all\nthe persistent subscriptions to a stream.\n\nThis method has one required argument, `stream_name`.\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, that is expected to be a\nPython `float`, which sets a deadline for the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method also has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\n```python\nsubscriptions = client.list_subscriptions_to_stream(\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n)\n```\n\nThe returned value is a list of `SubscriptionInfo` objects.\n\n\n### Delete subscription\n\n*requires leader*\n\nThe `delete_subscription()` method can be used to delete a persistent\nsubscription.\n\nThis method has a required `group_name` argument and an optional `stream_name`\nargument, which should match the values of arguments used when calling either\n`create_subscription_to_all()` or `create_subscription_to_stream()`.\n\nThis method has an optional `timeout` argument, that\nis expected to be a Python `float`, which sets a deadline\nfor the completion of the gRPC operation.\n\nThis method also has an optional `credentials` argument, which can be used to\noverride call credentials derived from the connection string URI.\n\nThe example below deletes the persistent subscription `group_name1` which\nwas created by calling `create_subscription_to_all()`.\n\n```python\nclient.delete_subscription(\n    group_name=group_name1,\n)\n```\n\nThe example below deleted the persistent subscription `group_name2` on\n`stream_name2` which was created by calling `create_subscription_to_stream()`.\n\n```python\nclient.delete_subscription(\n    group_name=group_name2,\n    stream_name=stream_name2,\n)\n```\n\n### Call credentials\n\nDefault call credentials are derived by the client from the user info part of the\nconnection string URI.\n\nMany of the client methods described above have an optional `credentials` argument,\nwhich can be used to set call credentials for an individual method call that override\nthose derived from the connection string URI.\n\n### Construct call credentials\n\nThe client method `construct_call_credentials()` can be used to construct a call\ncredentials object from a username and password.\n\n```python\ncall_credentials = client.construct_call_credentials(\n    username=\'admin\', password=\'changeit\'\n)\n```\n\nThe call credentials object can be used as the value of the `credentials`\nargument in other client methods.\n\n## Connection\n\n### Reconnect\n\nThe `reconnect()` method can be used to manually reconnect the client to a\nsuitable EventStoreDB node. This method uses the same routine for reading the\ncluster node states and then connecting to a suitable node according to the\nclient\'s node preference that is specified in the connection string URI when\nthe client is constructed. This method is thread-safe, in that when it is called\nby several threads at the same time, only one reconnection will occur. Concurrent\nattempts to reconnect will block until the client has reconnected successfully,\nand then they will all return normally.\n\n```python\nclient.reconnect()\n```\n\nAn example of when it might be desirable to reconnect manually is when (for performance\nreasons) the client\'s node preference is to be connected to a follower node in the\ncluster, and, after a cluster leader election, the follower becomes the leader.\nReconnecting to a follower node in this case is currently beyond the capabilities of\nthis client, but this behavior might be implemented in a future release.\n\nReconnection will happen automatically in many cases, due to the `@autoreconnect`\ndecorator.\n\n### Close\n\nThe `close()` method can be used to cleanly close the client\'s gRPC connection.\n\n```python\nclient.close()\n```\n\n\n## Asyncio client\n\nThe `esdbclient` package also includes an early version of an asynchronous I/O\ngRPC Python client. It follows exactly the same behaviors as the multithreaded\n`EventStoreDBClient`, but uses the `grpc.aio` package and the `asyncio` module, instead of\n`grpc` and `threading`.\n\nThe async function `AsyncioEventStoreDBClient` constructs the client, and connects to\na server. It can be imported from `esdbclient`, and can be called with the same\narguments as `EventStoreDBClient`. It supports both the "esdb" and the "esdb+discover"\nconnection string URI schemes, and can connect to both "secure" and "insecure"\nEventStoreDB servers. It reconnects or retries when connection issues or server\nerrors are encountered.\n\n```python\nfrom esdbclient import AsyncioEventStoreDBClient\n```\n\nThe asynchronous I/O client has the following methods: `append_to_stream()`,\n`get_stream()`, `read_all()`, `subscribe_to_all()`,\n`delete_stream()`, `tombstone_stream()`, and `reconnect()`.\n\nThese methods are equivalent to the methods on `EventStoreDBClient`. They have the same\nmethod signatures, and can be called with the same arguments, to the same effect.\nThe methods which appear on `EventStoreDBClient` but not on `AsyncioEventStoreDBClient` will be\nadded soon.\n\n### Synopsis\n\nThe example below demonstrates the `append_to_stream()`, `get_stream()` and\n`subscribe_to_all()` methods. These are the most useful methods for writing\nan event-sourced application, allowing new aggregate events to be recorded, the\nrecorded events of an aggregate to be obtained so aggregates can be reconstructed,\nand the state of an application to propagated and processed with "exactly-once"\nsemantics.\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def demonstrate_asyncio_client():\n\n    # Construct client.\n    client = await AsyncioEventStoreDBClient(\n        uri=os.getenv("ESDB_URI"),\n        root_certificates=os.getenv("ESDB_ROOT_CERTIFICATES"),\n    )\n\n    # Append events.\n    stream_name = str(uuid.uuid4())\n    event1 = NewEvent("OrderCreated", data=b\'{}\')\n    event2 = NewEvent("OrderUpdated", data=b\'{}\')\n    event3 = NewEvent("OrderDeleted", data=b\'{}\')\n\n    commit_position = await client.append_to_stream(\n        stream_name=stream_name,\n        current_version=StreamState.NO_STREAM,\n        events=[event1, event2, event3]\n    )\n\n    # Read stream events.\n    recorded = await client.get_stream(stream_name)\n    assert len(recorded) == 3\n    assert recorded[0].id == event1.id\n    assert recorded[1].id == event2.id\n    assert recorded[2].id == event3.id\n\n\n    # Subscribe all events.\n    received = []\n    async for event in await client.subscribe_to_all():\n        received.append(event)\n        if event.commit_position == commit_position:\n            break\n    assert received[-3].id == event1.id\n    assert received[-2].id == event2.id\n    assert received[-1].id == event3.id\n\n\n    # Close the client.\n    await client.close()\n\n\n# Run the demo.\nasyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(\n    demonstrate_asyncio_client()\n)\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n### Regular expression filters\n\nThe `read_all()`, `subscribe_to_all()`, `create_subscription_to_all()`\nand `get_commit_position()` methods have `filter_exclude` and `filter_include`\narguments. This section provides some more details about the values of these\narguments.\n\nThe first thing to note is that these arguments are sequences of regular expressions.\nThey are concatenated together by the client as bracketed alternatives in a larger\nregular expression that is anchored to the start and end of the strings being\nmatched. So you shouldn\'t include the `\'^\'` and `\'$\'` anchor characters, unless\nthese characters are escaped as literal characters to be matched. But you should\nuse wildcards if you want to match substrings, for example `\'.*Snapshot\'` to match\nall strings that end with `\'Snapshot`\'.\n\nIn all methods, the default value of the `filter_exclude` argument is the constant\n`DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_FILTER`, which is designed to exclude EventStoreDB "system" and\n"persistence subscription config" event types, which otherwise would be included.\n\nSystem events generated by EventStoreDB have `type` strings that start with\nthe `$` sign. Persistence subscription events generated when manipulating\npersistence subscriptions have `type` strings that start with `PersistentConfig`.\n\nFor example, to match the type of EventStoreDB system events, use the regular\nexpression string `r\'\\$.+\'`. Please note, the constant `ESDB_SYSTEM_EVENTS_REGEX` is\nset to this value. You can import this constant from `esdbclient` and use it when\nbuilding longer sequences of regular expressions.\n\nSimilarly, to match the type of EventStoreDB persistence subscription events, use the\nregular expression `r\'PersistentConfig\\d+\'`. The constant `ESDB_PERSISTENT_CONFIG_EVENTS_REGEX`\nis set to this value. You can import this constant from `esdbclient`  and use it when\nbuilding longer sequences of regular expressions.\n\nThe constant `DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_FILTER` is a sequence of regular expressions that includes\nboth `ESDB_SYSTEM_EVENTS_REGEX` and `ESDB_PERSISTENT_CONFIG_EVENTS_REGEX`. It is used\nas the default value of `filter_exclude` so that the events that EventStoreDB generates\ninternally are excluded by default.\n\nFor example, if you want to exclude snapshots and system events and persistent subscription\nevents, then you may wish to use a appropriately extended copy of `DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_FILTER`\nas the value of the `filter_exclude` arguments, such as `DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_FILTER + [\'.*Snapshot\']`.\n\n\n### Reconnect and retry method decorators\n\nPlease note, nearly all the client methods are decorated with the `@autoreconnect` and\nthe `@retrygrpc` decorators.\n\nThe `@autoreconnect` decorator will reconnect to a suitable node in the cluster when\nthe server to which the client has been connected has become unavailable, or when the\nclient\'s gRPC channel happens to have been closed. The client will also reconnect when\na method is called that requires a leader, and the client\'s node preference is to be\nconnected to a leader, but the node that the client has been connected to stops being\nthe leader. In this case, the client will reconnect to the current leader. After\nreconnecting, the failed operation will be retried.\n\nThe `@retrygrpc` decorator retries operations that have failed due to a deadline being\nreached (so that the operation times out), and in case the server throws an exception\nwhen handling a client request.\n\nPlease also note, the aspects not covered by the reconnect and retry decorator\nbehaviours have to do with methods that return iterators. For example, consider\nthe "read response" iterator returned from the `read_all()` method. The\n`read_all()` method will have returned, and the method decorators will therefore\nhave exited, before iterating over the "read response" begins. Therefore, if a\nconnection issues occurs whilst iterating over the "read response", it isn\'t possible\nfor any decorator on the `read_all()` method to trigger a reconnection.\n\nWith the "catch-up subscription" objects, there is an initial "confirmation" response\nfrom the server which is received and checked by the client. And so, when a call is\nmade to `subscribe_to_all()` or `subscribe_to_stream()`, if the server is unavailable,\nor if the channel has somehow been closed, or if the request fails for some other reason,\nthen the client will reconnect and retry. However, if an exception is raised when iterating over a\nsuccessfully returned "catch-up subscription" object, the catch-up subscription will\nneed to be restarted. Similarly, when reading persistent subscriptions, if there are\nconnection issues whilst iterating over a successfully received response, the consumer\nwill need to be restarted.\n\n\n## Contributors\n\n### Install Poetry\n\nThe first thing is to check you have Poetry installed.\n\n    $ poetry --version\n\nIf you don\'t, then please [install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer).\n\n    $ curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -\n\nIt will help to make sure Poetry\'s bin directory is in your `PATH` environment variable.\n\nBut in any case, make sure you know the path to the `poetry` executable. The Poetry\ninstaller tells you where it has been installed, and how to configure your shell.\n\nPlease refer to the [Poetry docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for guidance on\nusing Poetry.\n\n### Setup for PyCharm users\n\nYou can easily obtain the project files using PyCharm (menu "Git > Clone...").\nPyCharm will then usually prompt you to open the project.\n\nOpen the project in a new window. PyCharm will then usually prompt you to create\na new virtual environment.\n\nCreate a new Poetry virtual environment for the project. If PyCharm doesn\'t already\nknow where your `poetry` executable is, then set the path to your `poetry` executable\nin the "New Poetry Environment" form input field labelled "Poetry executable". In the\n"New Poetry Environment" form, you will also have the opportunity to select which\nPython executable will be used by the virtual environment.\n\nPyCharm will then create a new Poetry virtual environment for your project, using\na particular version of Python, and also install into this virtual environment the\nproject\'s package dependencies according to the project\'s `poetry.lock` file.\n\nYou can add different Poetry environments for different Python versions, and switch\nbetween them using the "Python Interpreter" settings of PyCharm. If you want to use\na version of Python that isn\'t installed, either use your favourite package manager,\nor install Python by downloading an installer for recent versions of Python directly\nfrom the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\nOnce project dependencies have been installed, you should be able to run tests\nfrom within PyCharm (right-click on the `tests` folder and select the \'Run\' option).\n\nBecause of a conflict between pytest and PyCharm\'s debugger and the coverage tool,\nyou may need to add ``--no-cov`` as an option to the test runner template. Alternatively,\njust use the Python Standard Library\'s ``unittest`` module.\n\nYou should also be able to open a terminal window in PyCharm, and run the project\'s\nMakefile commands from the command line (see below).\n\n### Setup from command line\n\nObtain the project files, using Git or suitable alternative.\n\nIn a terminal application, change your current working directory\nto the root folder of the project files. There should be a Makefile\nin this folder.\n\nUse the Makefile to create a new Poetry virtual environment for the\nproject and install the project\'s package dependencies into it,\nusing the following command.\n\n    $ make install-packages\n\nIt\'s also possible to also install the project in \'editable mode\'.\n\n    $ make install\n\nPlease note, if you create the virtual environment in this way, and then try to\nopen the project in PyCharm and configure the project to use this virtual\nenvironment as an "Existing Poetry Environment", PyCharm sometimes has some\nissues (don\'t know why) which might be problematic. If you encounter such\nissues, you can resolve these issues by deleting the virtual environment\nand creating the Poetry virtual environment using PyCharm (see above).\n\n### Project Makefile commands\n\nYou can start EventStoreDB using the following command.\n\n    $ make start-eventstoredb\n\nYou can run tests using the following command (needs EventStoreDB to be running).\n\n    $ make test\n\nYou can stop EventStoreDB using the following command.\n\n    $ make stop-eventstoredb\n\nYou can check the formatting of the code using the following command.\n\n    $ make lint\n\nYou can reformat the code using the following command.\n\n    $ make fmt\n\nTests belong in `./tests`. Code-under-test belongs in `./esdbclient`.\n\nEdit package dependencies in `pyproject.toml`. Update installed packages (and the\n`poetry.lock` file) using the following command.\n\n    $ make update-packages\n',
